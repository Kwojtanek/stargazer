It is among the nearest star clusters to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the naked eye in the night sky. The celestial entity has several meanings in different cultures and traditions.\nThe cluster is dominated by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades was probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood."},{"id":10614,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"I2602"}],"constelation":"car","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/10614?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/10961793043_cf871385b3_b.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/10961793043_cf871385b3_b.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/10961793043_cf871385b3_b.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/10961793043_cf871385b3_b.jpg","photo_url":null,"photo_thumbnail":null},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/IC_2602.jpg/560px-IC_2602.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/IC_2602.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/IC_2602.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/IC_2602.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/IC_2602.jpg/560px-IC_2602.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"I2602","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"","rightAsc":"10:42:58","declination":"-64 02 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":1.9,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, co, incl theta Car","id1":"Theta Carinae cluster","id2":"","id3":"","notes":"The Southern Pleiades","overview":"IC 2602, also known as the Theta Carinae Cluster or Southern Pleiades, is an open cluster in the constellation Carina.

It forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which lies a further 20 degrees to the east, and like the LMC is a member of the Local Group."},{"id":3372,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"3372"}],"constelation":"car","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/3372?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/EtaCar_RGB_18.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/EtaCar_RGB_18.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/EtaCar_RGB_18.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/EtaCar_RGB_18.jpg","photo_url":null,"photo_thumbnail":null},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Carina_Nebula.jpg/587px-Carina_Nebula.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carina_Nebula.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carina_Nebula.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carina_Nebula.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Carina_Nebula.jpg/587px-Carina_Nebula.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg/403px-Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg/403px-Carina_Nebula_by_ESO.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg/436px-ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg/436px-ESO-Trumpler14-cluster.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/EtaCarinae.jpg/400px-EtaCarinae.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/EtaCarinae.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/EtaCarinae.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/EtaCarinae.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/EtaCarinae.jpg/400px-EtaCarinae.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg/220px-Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg/220px-Eta_Carinae_winds%26radiation.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg/452px-Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg/452px-Hubble%27s_Wide_View_of_%27Mystic_Mountain%27_in_Infrared.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"3372","otype":"Interstellar matter","type":"HII (ionized) region","type_shortcut":"HII","classe":"EN","rightAsc":"10:44:19","declination":"-59 53 21","distance":null,"magnitudo":3.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"! great neb, eta Car","id1":"ESO 128-EN13","id2":" ","id3":"","notes":"Eta Car nebula","overview":"The Carina Nebula (also known as the Great Nebula in Carina, the Eta Carinae Nebula, NGC 3372, as well as the Grand Nebula) is a large bright nebula that has within its boundaries several related open clusters of stars, all part of the large OB association Carina OB1.

The 2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes for Praesepe members and the latest iteration of color-magnitude diagram fitting in the infrared favor an analogous distance near 182 pc.

The clusters were first recorded by Hipparchus, but have likely been known since antiquity.\r\nThe Double Cluster is a favorite of amateur astronomers. These bright clusters are often photographed or observed with small telescopes. Easy to find, the clusters are visible with the unaided eye between the constellations of Perseus and Cassiopeia as a brighter patch in the winter Milky Way.\r\nIn small telescopes the cluster appears as a beautiful assemblage of bright stars located in a rich star field.

Astronomers have directly observed protoplanetary disks, brown dwarfs, intense and turbulent motions of the gas, and the photo-ionizing effects of massive nearby stars in the nebula."},{"id":4755,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4755"}],"constelation":"cru","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4755?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg/812px-A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg/812px-A_Hubble_gem_-_the_Jewel_Box.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg/399px-A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg/399px-A_Snapshot_of_the_Jewel_Box_cluster_with_the_ESO_VLT.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg/397px-Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg/397px-Digitized_Sky_Survey_2_Image_of_NGC_4755.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg/580px-Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg/580px-Putting_the_Jewel_Box_in_perspective_%28composite_image%29.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg/400px-Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg/400px-Wide_Field_Image_of_the_Jewel_Box.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4755","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"I3r","rightAsc":"12:53:39","declination":"-60 21 07","distance":null,"magnitudo":4.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, vL, st vB (kappa Cru)","id1":"OCL 892","id2":"ESO 131-SC16","id3":"","notes":"Jewel Box, Kappa Cru cl.","overview":"The Jewel Box, Kappa Crucis Cluster, NGC 4755, is an open cluster in the constellation Crux, originally discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille during 1751â1752.

This famous cluster was later named the Jewel Box by Sir John Herschel when he described its telescopic appearance as \"a casket of variously coloured precious stones.\" It is easily visible to the naked eye as a hazy star some 1.0Â° southeast of the first-magnitude star Beta Crucis. This hazy star (the core of the cluster) was assigned the Bayer star designation Kappa Crucis, from which the cluster takes one of its common names. The modern designation Kappa Crucis has been assigned to one of the stars in the central A-shaped asterism of the cluster, the third brightest cluster star (HD 111973, HIP 62931, HR 4890), located at the base of the right leg of the A.

The cluster itself covers an area around the size of the full moon. It contains about 100 stars including several red giants, the brightest being a spectral type K3 giant of apparent magnitude 6.3 near the cluster's center, and a number of white dwarfs. The cluster is estimated to be moving away from us at 23.3 km/s. The diameter of the cluster is between 25 and 26 light years. It is estimated to be 190 million years old, and cluster properties and dynamics suggest a total life expectancy of 500 million years for this cluster, before it will have disintegrated.\r\nWalter Scott Houston describes the appearance of the cluster in small telescopes:\r\n\r\nMany visual observers speak of seeing curved lines of stars in M41.

It can be observed with a H? filter (isolates the H? line at 486 nm) in a rich-field telescope under dark skies. It lies at a distance of about 1,000 light years from Earth.

It was probably discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. Messier described it as, \"A cluster of small stars a little below the parallel of ? (Andromedae). In an ordinary telescope of 3 feet one can distinguish the stars.\"\r\nBased on the distance modulus of 8.38, this cluster is located at a distance of about 470 parsecs, or 1,500 light years. For stars in the range from 0.12 to 1.0 solar masses, M34 contains an estimated 400 members. It spans about 35' on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7 light years. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, well away from city lights. It is possible to see it in binoculars when light pollution is limited.\r\nThe age of this cluster lies between the respective ages of the Pleiades open cluster at 100 million years and the Hyades open cluster at 800 million years. Comparisons between the observed stellar spectra and the values predicted by stellar evolutionary models gives an age estimate of 200â250 million years for M34. This is roughly the age at which stars with 0.5 solar masses enter the main sequence. By comparison, stars like the Sun enter the main sequence after 30 million years.\r\nThe average proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is termed the metallicity by astronomers. This is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen, compared to the same proportion in the Sun. For M34, the metallicity has a value of [Fe/H] = +0.07 Âą 0.04. This is equivalent to a 17% higher proportion of iron compared to the Sun. Other elements show a similar abundance, with the exception of nickel which is underabundant.\r\nAt least 19 members of this cluster are white dwarfs. These are stellar remnants of progenitor stars of up to eight solar masses that have evolved through the main sequence and are no longer engaged in thermonuclear fusion to generate energy. Seventeen of the white dwarfs are of spectral type DA or DAZ, while one is a type DB and the last is a type DC.\r\n^ a b c d e Jones, Kenneth Glyn (1991). Messier's nebulae and star clusters.

James Dunlop described the cluster as a \"curiously curved line of pretty bright stars, with many stars mixt\". John Herschel then described the cluster as both \"pretty bright\" and \"pretty rich\".\nThis cluster has a tidal radius of 26 ly (8.0 pc) and a mass of about 214 solar masses.

M37 was missed by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil when he rediscovered M36 and M38 in 1749.

It is classified as Trumpler type I,1,r or I,2,r.\r\nM37 is located in the antipodal direction, opposite from the Galactic Center as seen from Earth. Estimates of its age range from 347 million to 550 million years. It has 1,500 times the mass of the Sun and contains over 500 identified stars, with roughly 150 stars brighter than magnitude 12.5.

It was discovered by Charles Messier on May 3, 1764, and resolved into stars by William Herschel around 1784. Since then, it has become one of the best-studied globular clusters. Identification of the cluster's unusually large variable star population was begun in 1913 by American astronomer Solon Irving Bailey and new variable members continue to be identified up through 2004.\r\n\r\nMany amateur astronomers consider it one of the finest northern globular clusters, following only Messier 13. M3 has an apparent magnitude of 6.2, making it a difficult naked eye target even with dark conditions. With a moderate-sized telescope, the cluster is fully defined. It can be a challenge to locate through the technique of star hopping, but can be found by looking almost exactly halfway along an imaginary line connecting the bright star Arcturus to Cor Caroli. Using a telescope with a 25 cm (9.8 in) aperture, the cluster has a bright core with a diameter of about 6 arcminutes and spans a total of 12 arcminutes.\r\nThis cluster is one of the largest and brightest, and is made up of around 500,000 stars. It is estimated to be 8 billion years old. It is located at a distance of about 33,900 light-years away from Earth.\r\nMessier 3 is located 31.6 kly (9.7 kpc) above the Galactic plane and roughly 38.8 kly (11.9 kpc) from the center of the Milky Way. It contains 274 known variable stars; by far the highest number found in any globular cluster. These include 133 RR Lyrae variables, of which about a third display the Blazhko effect of long-period modulation. The overall abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is in the range of â1.34 to â1.50 dex. This value gives the logarithm of the abundance relative to the Sun; the actual proportion is 3.2â4.6% of the solar abundance. Messier 3 is the prototype for the Oosterhoff type I cluster, which is considered \"metal-rich\". That is, for a globular cluster, Messier 3 has a relatively high abundance of heavier elements."},{"id":2437,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2437"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"46"}],"constelation":"pup","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2437?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg/530px-Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg/530px-Messier_46_-_NGC_2437.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2437","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"III2m","rightAsc":"07:41:46","declination":"-14 04 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":6.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"!, Cl, vB, vRi, vL, invPN ; = M46","id1":"OCL 601","id2":"","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"Messier 46 (also known as M 46 or NGC 2437) is an open cluster in the constellation of Puppis.

It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1777, then published in the Jahrbuch during 1779. The cluster was independently rediscovered by Charles Messier on March 18, 1781 and added as the 92nd entry in his catalogue. M92 is at a distance of about 26,700 light-years away from Earth.\nM92 is one of the brighter globular clusters in the northern hemisphere, but it is often overlooked by amateur astronomers because of its proximity to the even more spectacular Messier 13. It is visible to the naked eye under very good conditions.\nAmong the Milky Way population of globular clusters, Messier 92 is among the brighter clusters in terms of absolute magnitude. It is also one of the oldest clusters. Messier 92 is located around 16Ă10^3 ly (4.9 kpc) above the galactic plane and 33Ă10^3 ly (10 kpc) from the Galactic Center. The heliocentric distance of Messier 92 is 26.7Ă10^3 ly (8.2 kpc). The half-light radius, or radius containing half of the light emission from the cluster, is 1.09 arcminutes, while the tidal radius is 15.17 arcminutes. It appears only slightly flattened, with the minor axis being about 89% Âą 3% as large as the major axis.\nCharacteristic of other globulars, Messier 92 has a very low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium; what astronomers term its metallicity. Relative to the Sun, the abundance of iron in the cluster is given by [Fe/H] = â2.29 dex, which equates to only 0.5% of the solar abundance. This puts the estimated age range for the cluster at 14.2 Âą 1.2 billion years, or roughly the age of the Universe.\nThe cluster is not currently in a state of core collapse and the core radius is about 2 arcseconds. It is an Oosterhoff type II (OoII) globular cluster, which means it belongs to the group of metal poor clusters with longer period RR Lyrae variable stars. The 1997 Catalogue of Variable Stars in Globular Clusters listed 28 candidate variable stars in the cluster, although only 20 have been confirmed.

At 15 cm (5.9 in), the core becomes visible and a few individual stars can be resolved along the periphery. Larger telescopes will provide greater resolution, with a 25 cm (9.8 in) telescope revealing a 2? core.\nM28 is at a distance of about 17,900 light-years away from Earth. It has a combined 551,000 times the mass of the Sun and is 12 billion years old. 18 RR Lyrae type variable stars have been observed in this cluster. In 1986, M28 became the first globular cluster where a millisecond pulsar, PSR B1821â24, was discovered with the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

The structure in the nebula is among the most complex ever observed in planetary nebulae. The spectrum of NGC 6302 shows that its central star is one of the hottest stars in the galaxy, with a surface temperature in excess of 200,000 K, implying that the star from which it formed must have been very large (cf. PG 1159 star).\r\nThe central star, a white dwarf, was only recently discovered (Szyszka et al. 2009), using the upgraded Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The star has a current mass of around 0.64 solar masses. It is surrounded by a particularly dense equatorial disc composed of gas and dust. This dense disc is postulated to have caused the star's outflows to form a bipolar structure (Gurzadyan 1997) similar to an hour-glass. This bipolar structure shows many interesting features seen in planetary nebulae such as ionization walls, knots and sharp edges to the lobes."},{"id":12,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"12"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"645"}],"constelation":"psc","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/12?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NGC_0012_2MASS.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NGC_0012_2MASS.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NGC_0012_2MASS.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NGC_0012_2MASS.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/NGC_0012_2MASS.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"12","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Galaxy","classe":"Sc","rightAsc":"00:08:44","declination":"04

It was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764, who described it as a circular nebula without a star. In the New General Catalogue, compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a \"remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval.\" This cluster can be easily viewed with a pair of 10Ă50 binoculars, forming a patch of hazy light some 4 arcminutes wide that is slightly elongated along the east-west axis. With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12 arcminutes across with a compressed core one arcminute wide. It is best observed around August.\nM30 is located at a distance of about 27,100 light-years from Earth, and is about 93 light-years across. The estimated age is roughly 12.93 billion years and it has a combined mass of about 160,000 times the mass of the Sun. The cluster is following a retrograde orbit through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a satellite galaxy rather than forming within the Milky Way. It is currently located at a distance of about 22.2 kly (6.8 kpc) from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated 26 kly (8.0 kpc) for the Sun.\nThe M30 cluster has passed through a dynamic process called core collapse and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the Sun's mass per cubic parsec. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create binary star systems, as well as a type of star called a blue straggler that is formed by mass transfer. A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster."},{"id":7789,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"7789"}],"constelation":"cas","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/7789?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg/556px-NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg/556px-NGC7789HunterWilson.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"7789","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"II1r","rightAsc":"23:57:24","declination":"56 42 05","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.2,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, vL, vRi, vmC, st 11...18","id1":"OCL 269","id2":" ","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 7789 is an open cluster in Cassiopeia that was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783.

It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, and can be seen from Earth by using binoculars.\r\nM29 is situated in the highly crowded area of Milky Way near Gamma Cygni, at a distance of 7,200 (most sources including Mallas/Kreimer and Burnham, and agreeing with early estimates or R.J. Trumpler 1930) or 4,000 light years (the latter from Kenneth Glyn Jones and the Sky Catalogue 2000.0). The Night Sky Observer's Guide by Kepple and Sanner gives a deviating value of 6,000 light years â the uncertainty due to inaccurately known absorption of the cluster's light.\r\nAccording to the Sky Catalog 2000, M29 is included in the Cygnus OB1 association, and approaching us at 28 km/s. Its age is estimated at 10 million years, as its five hottest stars are all giants of spectral class B0. The Night Sky Observer's Guide gives the apparent brightness of the brightest star as 8.59 visual magnitudes. The absolute magnitude may be an impressive -8.2 mag, or a luminosity of 160,000 Suns. The linear diameter was estimated at only 11 light years. Its Trumpler class is III,3,p,n (as it is associated with nebulosity), although GĂśtz gives, differently, II,3,m, and Kepple/Sanner gives I,2,m,n. The Sky Catalogue 2000.0 lists it with 50 member stars; earlier Becvar gave only the number of 20 members.\r\nThis cluster can be seen in binoculars. In telescopes, lowest powers are best. The brightest stars of M29 form a \"stubby dipper\", as Mallas says it. The four brightest stars form a quadrilateral, and another three, a triangle north of them. It is often known as the \"cooling tower\" due to its resemblance to the hyperboloid-shaped structures. A few fainter stars are around them, but the cluster appears quite isolated, especially in smaller telescopes. In photographs, a large number of very faint Milky Way background stars shows up.\r\nM29 can be found quite easily as it is about 1.7 degrees South and little East of Gamma or 37 Cygni (Sadr). In the vicinity of M29, there is some diffuse nebulosity which can be detected in photographs."},{"id":281,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"281"}],"constelation":"cas","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/281?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/IC_1590_HST.jpg/393px-IC_1590_HST.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/IC_1590_HST.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/IC_1590_HST.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/IC_1590_HST.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/IC_1590_HST.jpg/393px-IC_1590_HST.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg/532px-NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg/532px-NGC281NBHunterWilson.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg/395px-NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg/395px-NGC_281_from_Chandra.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg/500px-The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg/500px-The_Pacman_Nebula.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"281","otype":"Interstellar matter","type":"HII (ionized) region","type_shortcut":"HII","classe":"OCL+EN","rightAsc":"00:52:25","declination":"56 33 54","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"","id1":"IC 11","id2":"OCL 313","id3":"LBN 616","notes":"in SMC","overview":"NGC 281 is an H II region in the constellation of Cassiopeia and part of the Perseus Spiral Arm.

It has an estimated 400 stars and spans about a quarter of a degree across the sky. It can reportedly be detected with the unaided eye, although a telescope is recommended for best viewing. The brightest members of the cluster can be viewed with binoculars. Although the listed visual magnitude is 7.1, several observers have reported higher estimates.\nAfter adjusting for reddening due to interstellar dust, the distance modulus is estimated as 11.6 magnitudes. It is located about 2,100 parsecs distant with an estimated age of 20â25 million years. This means that stars of spectral class B2 or higher (in the sense of higher mass), are reaching the end of their main sequence lifespan. This cluster appears to be located in front of a molecular cloud, although the two are not physically associated. This cloud has the effect of blocking background stars from the visual image of the cluster as it lies at a distance of 300 parsecs.\nThis cluster is of interest because of the high number of Be stars, with a total of about 24 discovered. These are spectral class B stars that show prominent emission lines of hydrogen in their spectrum. Most of the Be stars in the cluster lie between spectral class B0 and B3. A candidate member of the cluster, LS I +61Â° 235, is a Be star with an X-ray binary component that has a period of about three years. There are at least five blue stragglers in the cluster. These are stars that formed by the merger of two other stars. Two of the cluster's star systems are likely eclipsing binaries with periods of 0.6 and 1.03 days. NGC 663 also has two red supergiant stars, both located on its periphery\nNGC 663 is assumed to form part of the stellar association Cassiopeia OB8, that is located in the Perseus arm of the Milky Way, along with the open clusters M103, NGC 654, NGC 659, and some supergiant stars scattered between them, all of them having similar ages and distances."},{"id":2360,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2360"}],"constelation":"cma","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2360?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/NGC_2360.png/467px-NGC_2360.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/NGC_2360.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/NGC_2360.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/NGC_2360.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/NGC_2360.png/467px-NGC_2360.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2360","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"II2m","rightAsc":"07:17:43","declination":"-15 38 05","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, vL, Ri, pC, st 9...12","id1":"OCL 589","id2":" ","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 2360, also known as Caroline's Cluster, is an open cluster in the constellation Canis Major.

The cluster lies 3.5 degrees east of Gamma Canis Majoris and less than one degree northwest of the eclipsing binary star R Canis Majoris; it has a combined apparent magnitude of 7.2. It is 13 arc minutes in diameter. By the western edge of the cluster is the unrelated star, 5.5-magnitude HD 56405.\nAmerican astronomer Olin J. Eggen surveyed the cluster in 1968, concluding that the brightest star in the field, magnitude-8.96 HD 56847, is likely to lie in the field and not a true member of the cluster. He also identified one or possibly two blue stragglers. These are unexpectedly hot and luminous stars that appear younger than surrounding stars, and have likely developed by sucking matter off companion stars. Four are now recognised to be in the cluster. By analysing the masses of the smallest stars that have evolved into red giantsânamely, stars of 1.8 or 1.9 solar massesâSwiss astronomers Jean-Claude Mermilliod and Michel Mayor were able to date the age of the cluster at 2.2 billion years.

M67's Trumpler class is variously given as II 2 r, II 2 m, or II 3 r. It was discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in 1779. Age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years, with the most recent estimate (4 Gyr) implying stars in M67 are younger than the Sun. Distance estimates are likewise varied and typically range between 800â900 pc. Recent estimates of 855, 840, and 815 pc were established via binary star modelling and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting, accordingly.\r\nM67 is not the oldest known open cluster, but there are few Galactic clusters known to be older, and none of those are as close as M67. M67 is an important laboratory for studying stellar evolution, since the cluster is well populated, obscured by negligible amounts of soot, and all its stars are at the same distance and age, except for approximately 30 anomalous blue stragglers, whose origins are not fully understood.\r\nM67 is the nearest old open cluster, and thus has become a standard example for studying stellar evolution. It is probably the second best observed open cluster after the Hyades cluster, which is amongst the nearest open clusters and younger than M67. M67 is one of the most-studied open clusters, yet estimates of its physical parameters such as age, mass, and number of stars of a given type, vary substantially. Richer et al. estimate its age to be 4 Gyr, its mass to be 1080 solar masses, and the number of white dwarfs to be 150. Hurley et al. estimate its current mass to be 1400 solar masses and its initial mass to be approximately 10 times as great.\r\nM67 has more than 100 stars similar to the Sun, and countless red giants. The total star count has been estimated at well over 500. The ages and prevalence of Sun-like stars contained within the cluster had led astronomers to consider M67 as the possible parent cluster of our own Sun. However, computer simulations have suggested that this is highly unlikely to be the case.\r\nThe cluster contains no main sequence stars bluer than spectral type F, other than perhaps some of the blue stragglers, since the brighter stars of that age have already left the main sequence. In fact, when the stars of the cluster are plotted on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there is a distinct \"turn-off\" representing the stars which have terminated hydrogen fusion in the core and are destined to become red giants. As the cluster ages, the turn-off moves progressively down the main sequence.\r\n\r\nIt appears that M67 does not contain an unbiased sample of stars. One cause of this is mass segregation, the process by which lighter stars (actually, systems) gain speed at the expense of more massive stars during close encounters, which causes the lighter stars to be at a greater average distance from the center of the cluster or to escape altogether"},{"id":6715,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6715"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"54"}],"constelation":"sgr","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6715?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/Messier_54_HST.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/Messier_54_HST.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/Messier_54_HST.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/Messier_54_HST.jpg","photo_url":"","photo_thumbnail":""}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6715","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"III","rightAsc":"18:55:03","declination":"-30 28 24","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"glob. cl. , vB, L, R, g, smbM, rrr, st 15; = M54","id1":"GCL 104","id2":"ESO 458-SC8","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"Messier 54 (also known as M54 or NGC 6715) is a globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius.

It is one of the denser of the globulars, being of class III (I being densest and XII being the least dense). It shines with the luminosity of roughly 850,000 times that of the Sun and has an absolute magnitude of ?10.0.\r\nAs it is located on SagDEG's center, some authors think it actually may be its core; however others have proposed that it is a real globular cluster that fell to the center of this galaxy due to decay of its orbit caused by dynamical friction.\r\nM54 is easily found in the sky, being close to the star ?

It was discovered by Philippe Loys de ChĂŠseaux in 1746 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects in 1780. It was also noted by Koehler at Dresden around 1775.\nM71 is at a distance of about 12,000 light years away from Earth and spans some 27 light years across. The irregular variable star Z Sagittae is a member of this cluster.\nM71 was long thought (until the 1970s) to be a densely packed open cluster and was classified as such by leading astronomers in the field of star cluster research due to its lacking a dense central compression, and to its stars having more \"metals\" than is usual for an ancient globular cluster; furthermore, it lacks the RR Lyrae \"cluster\" variable stars that are common in most globulars. However, modern photometric photometry has detected a short \"horizontal branch\" in the H-R diagram of M71, which is characteristic of a globular cluster. The shortness of the branch explains the lacking of the RR Lyrae variables and is due to the globular's relatively young age of 9-10 billion years. The relative youth of this globular also explains the abundance of \"metals\" in its stars. Hence today M71 is designated as a very loosely concentrated globular cluster, much like M68 in Hydra.

It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (10â16 million light-years). NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the fifth brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target, although the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about one half of the speed of light.

It is not, as its name might suggest, in Cancer. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\nAt an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn's moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% c.\nAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28â30 kilometres (17â19 mi) across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab is generally the strongest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula's radiation allows for the detailed studying of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped from observations of the Crab's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula."},{"id":3521,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"3521"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"33550"}],"constelation":"leo","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/3521?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg/490px-Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg/490px-Hubble_shears_a_woolly_galaxy.jpg"},{"thumb":"/media/images/ngc3521.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/ngc3521.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/ngc3521.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/ngc3521.jpg","photo_url":"","photo_thumbnail":""}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"3521","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Low Surface Brightness Galaxy","type_shortcut":"LSB_G","classe":"SAB(rs)bc","rightAsc":"11:05:48","declination":"00 02 09","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"cB, cL, mE 140deg +/- ,vsmbMN","id1":"UGC 6150","id2":"MCG 0-28-30","id3":"ZWG 10.74","notes":"KARA 461","overview":null},{"id":6204,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6204"}],"constelation":"ara","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6204?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/NGC_6204.png/500px-NGC_6204.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/NGC_6204.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/NGC_6204.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/NGC_6204.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/NGC_6204.png/500px-NGC_6204.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6204","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"I2p","rightAsc":"16:46:08","declination":"-47 01 02","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, pRi, eiCM, st 11...12","id1":"OCL 982","id2":"ESO 277-SC10","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 6204 is an open cluster in the constellation Ara, lying close to the galactic equator."},{"id":6885,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6885"}],"constelation":"vul","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6885?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/NGC_6885.png/533px-NGC_6885.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/NGC_6885.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/NGC_6885.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/NGC_6885.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/NGC_6885.png/533px-NGC_6885.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6885","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"III2p","rightAsc":"20:12:01","declination":"26 28 07","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, vB, vL, Ri, lC, st6...11","id1":"NGC 6882","id2":"OCL 152","id3":"","notes":"with 20 Vul","overview":"NGC 6885, also Caldwell 37, is an open cluster in the constellation Vulpecula.

His son, John Herschel, described it as \"a superb cluster resolvable into countless stars\". The cluster is located 4.5Â° WSW of Theta Ophiuchi and is just visible as a fuzzy point of light using 50 mm (2.0 in) binoculars. Using a telescope with a 25.4 cm (10.0 in) aperture, the cluster shows an oval appearance with a 3? Ă 4? core and a 5? Ă 7? halo.\r\nM19 is one of the most oblate of the known globular clusters. This flattening may not accurately reflect the physical shape of the cluster because the emitted light is being strongly absorbed along the eastern edge. This is the result of extinction caused by intervening gas and dust. When viewed in the infrared, the cluster shows almost no flattening. It lies at a distance of about 28.7 kly (8.8 kpc) from the Solar System, and is quite near to the Galactic Center at only about 6.5 kly (2.0 kpc) away.\r\nThis cluster contains an estimated 1,100,000 times the mass of the Sun and it is around 11.9 billion years old. The stellar population includes four Cepheids and RV Tauri variables, plus at least one RR Lyrae variable for which a period is known.

The core is an oval shape with an apparent size of about 50? Ă 40?. The spiral arms extend in a wide curve north and south from the ends of the east-west bar and form an almost ring like Z-shaped halo. The central mass in active galactic nucleus rotate close to relativistic limit (the dimensionless spin parameter is larger than 0.84).\nSupernovae 2012fr, 2001du, 1983V, and 1957C were observed in NGC 1365.\nIn February 2013, observations using the NuSTAR satellite have found out that the central supermassive black hole of NGC 1365, measured to be about 2 million solar masses in mass, is spinning at almost the speed of light.\n\n^ a b c d e f g \"NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\".

Its loosely bound spiral arms categorize it as Hubble-type Sbc. It is 60 million light years away, and part of the Sculptor constellation.\nThe VLT image of the galaxy (shown right) reveals the following. A prominent feature of NGC 134 is its warped disc, i.e., when viewed sideways it does not appear flat. A trail of gas is stripped from the top edge of the disc. Together, these features suggest that it interacted with another galaxy, but that remains unproven. The galaxy has an abundance of ionized hydrogen regions along its spiral arms where stars are forming. These regions appear red in the picture. It also has many dark lanes of dust that occlude its complete starlight.\nThe discovery of NGC 134 is often attributed to Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope,but he did note that it might have been the 590th object discovered by James Dunlop in his 1828 publication, six years prior to Herschel's own observations.\nSupernova 2009gj in NGC 134 was discovered in 2009 by a farmer in New Zealand."},{"id":221,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"221"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"2555"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"32"}],"constelation":"and","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/221?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg/609px-Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg/609px-Andromeda_Galaxy_%28with_h-alpha%29.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/M32_Lanoue.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/M32_Lanoue.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/M32_Lanoue.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/M32_Lanoue.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/M32_Lanoue.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"221","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Interacting Galaxies","type_shortcut":"IG","classe":"cE2","rightAsc":"00:42:41","declination":"40 51 54","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"! vvB, L, R, psmbMN; = M32","id1":"UGC 452","id2":"MCG 7-2-15","id3":"ZWG 535.16","notes":"","overview":"Messier 32 (also known as NGC 221 and Le Gentil) is a dwarf elliptical galaxy about 2.65 million light-years away in the constellation Andromeda.

Messier 51 is one of the best known galaxies in the sky. The galaxy and its companion, NGC 5195, are easily observed by amateur astronomers, and the two galaxies may even be seen with binoculars.

It looks much like an elliptical galaxy. However, it is peculiar for two reasons. First, it shows wispy edges and scattered dust clouds that are probably a result of gravitational interaction with its larger neighbors, similar to the galaxy M82. Second, this galaxy has an active nucleus. This caused Carl Seyfert in 1943 to include it in his list of galaxies, which are now called Seyfert Galaxies. However, NGC 3077, though an emission line galaxy, is today no longer classified as a Seyfert galaxy.\nNGC 3077 was discovered by William Herschel on November 8, 1801. He remarked that \"On the nF (NE) side, there is a faint ray interrupting the roundness.\" Admiral Smyth described it as \"A bright-class round nebula; it is a lucid white, and lights up in the centre ... between these [stars,] the sky is intensely black, and shows the nebula as if floating in awful and illimitable space, at an inconceivable distance.\""},{"id":3918,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"3918"}],"constelation":"cen","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/3918?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg/400px-Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg/400px-Planetary_nebula_NGC_3918.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"3918","otype":"Interstellar matter","type":"Planetary Nebula","type_shortcut":"PN","classe":"PN","rightAsc":"11:50:17","declination":"-57 10 56","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"PN , !, S, R, blue, = *7, d = 1s .5","id1":"PK 294+4.1","id2":"ESO 170-PN13","id3":"AM 1147-565","notes":"CS=10.8, Blue planetary","overview":"NGC 3918 is a bright planetary nebula in the constellation Centaurus, that is called the \"Blue Planetary\" or \"The Southerner\". It is the brightest of the far southern planetary nebulae. This nebula was discovered by Sir John Herschel in March 1834, and is easily visible through small telescopes.

It is the only such galaxy having, as its host, a \"late-type lenticular galaxy\". It was probably formed when two galaxies collided a billion years ago. However, it may have first started as a disk galaxy that captured matter from a passing galaxy. This material could have, over time, become \"strung out\" to form a rotating ring.\nThe ring is not actually polar, but rather has an inclination from the plane of the host disk of approximately 45 degrees. The extreme number of pinkish star-forming areas that occurs along the galaxy's ring could be the result of the gravitation interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across - much broader than the disk itself - and has a greater amount of gas and star formation than the host ring. This likely indicates a very violent formation. The polar ring contains objects numbering in the hundreds. Many of these are red and blue supergiant stars. The most recently created stars in the ring were just formed approximately 7 million years ago. This indicates that the formation of these stars has been a long process and is still occurring.\nData about the dark matter halo of NGC 660 can be extracted by observing the gravitational effects of the dark matter on the disk and ring's rotation. From the core of the disk, radio waves are being emitted. The source of these waves is an area only 21 light years across.

Analysis of this patch by the infrared telescope Herschel (October 9, 2009), which has the capability of penetrating such dense cloud material, resulted in continued black space. This led to the belief that either the cloud material was immensely dense or that an unexplained phenomenon had been detected.\r\nWith support from ground-based observations done using the submillimeter bolometer cameras on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment radio telescope (November 29, 2009) and the Mayall (Kitt Peak) and Magellan telescopes (December 4, 2009), it was determined that the patch looks black not because it is an extremely dense pocket of gas, but because it is truly empty. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still being investigated, although it has been hypothesized that narrow jets of gas from some of the young stars in the region punctured the sheet of dust and gas, as well as, powerful radiation from a nearby mature star may have helped to create the hole. Researchers believe this discovery should lead to a better understanding of the entire star forming process.\r\nIt is located 1,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Orion."},{"id":5982,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5982"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"55674"}],"constelation":"dra","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5982?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/ngc5982.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/ngc5982.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/ngc5982.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/ngc5982.jpg","photo_url":"","photo_thumbnail":""}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"5982","otype":"Galaxy","type":"LINER-type Active Galaxy Nucleus","type_shortcut":"LINER","classe":"E","rightAsc":"15:38:39","declination":"59 21 21","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.5,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"cB, S, R, psbM, r","id1":"UGC 9961","id2":"MCG 47413","id3":"ZWG 297.24","notes":"","overview":null},{"id":1427,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"1427"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"13500"}],"constelation":"eri","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/1427?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/400px-NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/400px-NGC_1427_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"1427","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"E5","rightAsc":"03:42:19","declination":"-35 23 33","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"","id1":"ESO 358-49","id2":"MCG -31","id3":"AM 0338-354","notes":"FCC 235","overview":"NGC 1427 is an elliptical galaxy.

One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clustersâM87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150-200 orbiting the Milky Wayâand its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.\r\nFrench astronomer Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while searching for objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, it has an almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is a supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), where it has been truncatedâpossibly by an encounter with another galaxy. Between the stars is a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by elements emitted from evolved stars."},{"id":6402,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6402"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"14"}],"constelation":"oph","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6402?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/M14HunterWilson.jpg/486px-M14HunterWilson.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/M14HunterWilson.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/M14HunterWilson.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/M14HunterWilson.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/M14HunterWilson.jpg/486px-M14HunterWilson.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6402","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"VIII","rightAsc":"17:37:36","declination":"-3 14 04","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"! glob. cl. , B, vL, R,eRi, vgmbM, rrr, st 15; =","id1":"GCL 72","id2":"","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"Messier 14 (also known as M14 or NGC 6402) is a globular cluster in the constellation Ophiuchus.

However, it can be viewed well in the peripheral vision (averted vision), which causes it to \"blink\" in and out of view as the observer's eye wanders.\nA distinctive feature of this nebula are the two bright patches on either side, which are known as FLIERs, or Fast Low-Ionization Emission Regions. They appear to be relatively young, moving outwards at supersonic speeds. According to Bruce Balick (University of Washington), \"some of their observed characteristics suggest that they are like sparks flung outward from the central star late in the very recent past (a thousand years ago). Yet their shapes ... seem to suggest that they are stationary, and that material ejected from the star flows past them, scraping gas from their surfaces. Future Hubble observations will monitor any changes in the positions of FLIERs to resolve this issue.

With a larger instrument, British astronomer John Herschel called it a bright \"cluster of stars of a round figure\". American astronomer Harlow Shapley noted a similarity to Messier 4 and Messier 12.\nThis cluster is visible as a faint nebula in a telescope with a 6 cm (2.4 in) aperture. the surrounding field stars become visible at 15 cm (5.9 in), while 25 cm (9.8 in) is sufficient to resolve the cluster with an angular diameter of 2.5?. At 30 cm (12 in) the core is resolved in a 1.25? diameter, showing a broad spread with darker regions to the south and east.\nBased upon a 2011 census of variable stars, Messier 72 is located at a distance of 54.57 Âą 1.17 kly (16.73 Âą 0.36 kpc) from the Sun. It has an estimated combined mass equal to 168,000 times the mass of the Sun and is around 9.5 billion years old.

This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have complex shapes.

In March 2006, a star in the galaxy, SN 2006bc, was spotted in the late stages of supernova.

It belongs to the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way, which is at a distance of 168,000 light years. NGC 2080 was discovered by John Frederick William Herschel in 1834. The Ghost Head Nebula has a diameter of 50 light-years and is named for the two distinct white patches it possesses, called the \"eyes of the ghost\". The western patch, called A1, has a bubble in the center which was created by the young, massive star it contains. The eastern patch, called A2, has several young stars in a newly formed cluster, but they are still obscured by their originating dust cloud. Because neither dust cloud has dissipated due to the stellar radiation, astronomers have deduced that both sets of stars formed within the past 10,000 years. These stars together have begun to create a bubble in the nebula with their outpourings of material, called stellar wind.\nThe presence of stars also greatly influences the color of the nebula. The western portion of the nebula has a dominant oxygen emission line because of a powerful star on the nebula's outskirts; this colors it green. The rest of the nebula's outskirts have a red hue due to the ionization of hydrogen. Because both hydrogen and oxygen are ionized in the central region, which appears pale yellow; when hydrogen is energized enough to emit a second wavelength of light, it appears blue, as in the area surrounding A1 and A2.\nNGC 2080 should not be confused with the Ghost Nebula (Sh2-136) or the Little Ghost Nebula (NGC 6369)."},{"id":4039,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4039"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"37969"}],"constelation":"crv","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4039?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg/402px-Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg/402px-Antennae_Galaxies_composite_of_ALMA_and_Hubble_observations.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg/403px-Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg/403px-Antennae_Galaxies_reloaded.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg/400px-VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg/400px-VLT_Observes_the_Antennae_Galaxies.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4039","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinPair","classe":"Sc","rightAsc":"12:01:53","declination":"-18 53 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"pF, pL","id1":"ESO 572-48","id2":"MCG -49","id3":"UGCA 265","notes":"ARP 244, VV 245, Antennae","overview":"The Antennae Galaxies, also known as NGC 4038/NGC 4039, are a pair of interacting galaxies in the constellation Corvus.

It appears as a greenish-yellowish hue in a small amateur telescope. It was discovered by William Herschel on September 7, 1782, using a telescope of his own design in the garden at his home in Datchet, England, and was one of his earliest discoveries in his sky survey. The nebula was originally a low-mass star that ejected its layers into space, forming the nebula. The central star is now a bright white dwarf star of apparent magnitude 11.5. The Saturn Nebula gets its name from its superficial resemblance to the planet Saturn with its rings nearly edge-on to the observer. It was so named by Lord Rosse in the 1840s, when telescopes had improved to the point that its Saturn-like shape could be discerned. William Henry Smyth said that the Saturn Nebula is one of Struve's nine \"Rare Celestial Objects.\"\r\nThe Saturn Nebula is a complex planetary nebula and contains many morphological and kinematic sub-systems in three dimensions. It includes a halo, jet-like streams, multiple shells, ansae (\"handles\"), and small-scale filaments and knots. The ansae are expanding non-radially from the central star. Although the ansae are most prominent in the Saturn Nebula, they are also visible in other planetary nebulae, including NGC 3242, NGC 6543 and NGC 2371-2.\r\nThe distance of the Saturn Nebula is not known precisely. Sabbadin et al. 2004 estimates the distance to be 5,200 light-years (1.6 kpc). In 1963 O'Dell estimated it to be 3,900 light-years (1.2 kpc), which gives an approximate diameter of 0.5 light years for the object as a whole.\r\nThe central star, a very hot bluish dwarf with a temperature of 55,000 K, from which the nebula is believed to originate, has an absolute magnitude of +1.5, which equates to a luminosity of about 20 solar luminosities and a visual magnitude of 11.5. This strong ultraviolet irradiation from the central star creates the characteristic fluorescent green tint of the nebula via the radiation of doubly ionized oxygen. The object overall has a visual magnitude of 8 and a radial velocity of 28 miles per second towards the Earth.\r\nThe nebula is 1 degree west of the star Nu Aquarii. The central portion measures 25? 17?, while the outer shell extends to 41? Ă 35?.

These relativistic electrons are detected as synchrotron radiation in the x-ray and radio wavelengths. The focus of this intense energy is the galactic center of NGC 383. The relativistic electron jets detected as synchrotron radiation extend for several thousand parsecs and then appear to dissipate at the ends in the form of streamers or filaments.

At this great distance it takes three billion years to make one trip around the galaxy.\r\nThe cluster is dim in comparison to more famous globular clusters such as M13. Nonetheless, NGC 2419 is a 9th magnitude object and is readily viewed, in good sky conditions, with good quality telescopes as small as 102mm (four inches) in aperture. Intrinsically it is one of the brightest and most massive globular clusters of our galaxy, having an absolute magnitude of -9.42 and being 900,000 times more massive than our Sun.\r\nIt was proposed too NGC 2419 could be, as Omega Centauri, the remmant of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy disrupted and accreted by the Milky Way.

It belongs to the Virgo Cluster of galaxies and is positioned near the northeastern edge of this assemblage. The morphological classification of NGC 4698 in the De Vaucouleurs system is SA(s)ab, which indicates a purely spiral structure with moderate to tightly wound arms. It is inclined to the line of sight from the Earth by an angle of 53Â° along a position angle of 170Â°.\nA unique feature of this galaxy is that the stars and dust of the nuclear disk are rotating in a direction that is aligned perpendicularly to the galactic disk. The bulge likewise appears elongated out of the galactic plane. This unusual alignment may have been the result of a past merger event.\nNGC 4698 is classified as a Seyfert-2 galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, which displays a prominent emission of radio and X-ray energy from the core while showing narrow emission lines in the optical spectrum. The unified model of Seyfert galaxies proposes that the nucleus of a Seyfert 2 galaxy is obscured by a thick torus of gas and dust. However, the varying X-ray emission of the core of NGC 4698 shows little indication of being obstructed, suggesting instead that the source of the energy emission is generally unobscured but anemic in nature."},{"id":5866,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5866"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"166188"}],"constelation":"dra","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5866?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png/340px-File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png/340px-File-Ngc5866_hst_big.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"5866","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert","classe":"-1","rightAsc":"15:06:29","declination":"55 45 47","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.7,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"","id1":"Keeler 690","id2":" ","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 5866 (also called the Spindle Galaxy or Messier 102) is a relatively bright lenticular or spiral galaxy in the constellation Draco.

In a more recent survey of the brighter planetaries, C.R.O'Dell (1963) derived a distance of 1,740 parsecs or about 5,600 light years, increasing the actual size to 0.8 light year, or nearly 50,000 AU. It has a faint central star that is variable, with a magnitude range of 12 to 16. The central star is a bluish dwarf with a continuous spectrum and a computed temperature of about 75,000K. The nuclei of the planetary nebulae are among the hottest stars known.\r\nNGC 7662 is a popular planetary nebula for casual observers. A small telescope will reveal a star-like object with slight nebulosity.

It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre MĂŠchain on 15 March 1781, along with nearby M99 and M100, and was cataloged by French astronomer Charles Messier on 13 April 1781 in his Catalogue des NĂŠbuleuses & des amas d'Ătoiles. Messier 98 has a blue shift and is approaching us at about 140 km/s.\nThe morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(s)ab, which indicates it is a spiral galaxy that displays mixed barred and non-barred features with intermediate to tightly-wound arms and no ring. It is highly inclined to the line of sight at an angle of 74Â° and has a maximum rotation velocity of 236 km/s. The combined mass of the stars in this galaxy is an estimated 76 billion (7.6 Ă 1010) times the mass of the Sun. It contains about 4.3 billion solar masses of neutral hydrogen and 85 million solar masses in dust. The nucleus is active, displaying characteristics of a \"transition\" type object. That is, it shows properties of a LINER-type galaxy intermixed with an H II region around the nucleus.\nNGC 4192 is a member of the Virgo Cluster, which is a large, relatively nearby cluster of galaxies. About 750 million years ago, NGC 4192 may have interacted with the large spiral galaxy NGC 4254. The two are now separated by a distance of 1,300,000 ly (400,000 pc)."},{"id":4568,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4568"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"42069"}],"constelation":"vir","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4568?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg/400px-NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg/400px-NGC4567-ngc4568-hst-606.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4568","otype":"Galaxy","type":"HII Galaxy","type_shortcut":"HII_G","classe":"SA(rs)bc","rightAsc":"12:36:34","declination":"11 14 19","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.9,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"vF, L, sf of Dneb","id1":"UGC 7776","id2":"MCG 2-32-152","id3":"ZWG 70.188","notes":"Siamese Twins","overview":"NGC 4567 and NGC 4568 (nicknamed the Siamese Twins or the Butterfly Galaxies) are a set of spiral galaxies about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo.

NGC 7129 is located just half a degree from nearby cluster NGC 7142.\nThe nebula is rosebud-shaped; the young stars have blown a large, oddly shaped bubble in the molecular cloud that once surrounded them at their birth. The rosy pink color comes from glowing dust grains on the surface of the bubble being heated by the intense light from the young stars within. The ultra-violet and visible light produced by the young stars is absorbed by the surrounding dust grains. They are heated by this process and release the energy at longer infrared wavelengths as photographed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The reddish colors in the false-colour infrared image suggest the distribution of hydrocarbon rich molecular material.\nThe much cooler molecular cloud outside the bubble is mostly invisible to Spitzer. However, three very young stars near the center of the nebula are sending jets of supersonic gas into the cloud. The collision of these jets heats carbon monoxide molecules in the nebula. This produces the complex nebulosity that appears like a stem of a rosebud."},{"id":262,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"262"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"2855"}],"constelation":"and","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/262?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NGC_262.png/400px-NGC_262.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/NGC_262.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/NGC_262.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/NGC_262.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/NGC_262.png/400px-NGC_262.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"262","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert 2 Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert_2","classe":"S0a","rightAsc":"00:48:47","declination":"31 57 25","distance":null,"magnitudo":11.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"eF, vS, R, v diffic","id1":"UGC 499","id2":"MCG 39571","id3":"MK 348","notes":"NPM1G +31.0015","overview":"NGC 262 (also known as Markarian 348) is a huge lenticular galaxy in the cluster LGG 14.

Observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory have shown it to be surrounded by a halo of hot gas about 120,000 parsecs across. The hot gas has a temperature of around 10,000,000 kelvins. The galaxy is one of the few elliptical galaxies proven to have significant amounts of dark matter. Large amounts of dark matter are necessary to prevent the gas from escaping the galaxy; the visible mass clearly is not large enough to hold such an extensive gas halo. The dark matter halo is estimated to have 10 times the mass of the stars in the galaxy.\nNGC 4555 is important because of its isolation. Most elliptical galaxies are found in the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies, and almost all those for which dark matter estimates are available are located in the centres of these larger systems. In these circumstances it impossible to know whether the dark matter is associated with the galaxy or the surrounding cluster. NGC 4555, as a field galaxy is not part of any group or cluster, and therefore provides strong evidence that dark matter can be associated with individual ellipticals."},{"id":6239,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6239"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"59083"}],"constelation":"her","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6239?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png/400px-NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png/400px-NGC_6239_hst_09042_R814B450.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6239","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Cluster of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinCl","classe":"4","rightAsc":"16:50:05","declination":"42 44 23","distance":null,"magnitudo":11.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"vF, pL, lE, dif; = IC 4625","id1":"UGC 10577","id2":"MCG 7-35-1","id3":"ZWG 225.2","notes":"ZWG 224.105, IRAS16484+4249","overview":"NGC 6239 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Hercules with a distinct core.

The large numbers of bright bluish knots are active star-forming regions where some very luminous and young stars can be perceived.\nBecause it is so faint, NGC 6118 is a challenging object to see with a small telescope.

The bright rim is the surface of the dense cloud that is being illuminated and ionized by a very bright, massive star (HD 206267) that is just to the west of IC 1396A.

The entire IC 1396 region is ionized by the massive star, except for dense globules that can protect themselves from the star's harsh ultraviolet rays.\nThe Elephant's Trunk nebula is now thought to be a site of star formation, containing several very young (less than 100,000 yr) stars that were discovered in infrared images in 2003. Two older (but still young, a couple of million years, by the standards of stars, which live for billions of years) stars are present in a small, circular cavity in the head of the globule. Winds from these young stars may have emptied the cavity.\nThe combined action of the light from the massive star ionizing and compressing the rim of the cloud, and the wind from the young stars shifting gas from the center outward lead to very high compression in the Elephant's Trunk nebula.

This activity is caused by matter flowing onto a 65 million solar mass (M?) supermassive black hole at the core. Morphologically, this is an unbarred lenticular galaxy with tightly-wound spiral arms, while shell and tidal tail features suggest that it has undergone a cosmologically-recent merger or interaction event. NGC 5548 is approximately 245 million light years away and appears in the constellation BoĂśtes. The apparent visual magnitude of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the V band.\nIn 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve nebulae listed by American astronomer Carl Keenan Seyfert that showed broad emission lines in their nuclei. Members of this class of objects became known as Seyfert galaxies, and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei. Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with radio telescopes showed an enhanced level of radio emission. Spectrograms of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few parsecs across, where temperature were around 7004140000000000000?14000 K and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of Âą450 km/s.\nAmong astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes photoionized, producing broad emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1â14 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.\nThe mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of 7007654000000000000?6.54+0.26\n?0.25Ă107 M?. In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the Sun. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548. Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of 6998300000000000000?0.03 M? per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of 6999920000000000000?0.92 M? each year. The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot corona spanning several light hours that is emitting X-rays. When this radiation reaches the optically thick part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1â2 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat."},{"id":7752,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"7752"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"72382"}],"constelation":"peg","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/7752?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/N7753s_cropped.jpg/425px-N7753s_cropped.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/N7753s_cropped.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/N7753s_cropped.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/N7753s_cropped.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/N7753s_cropped.jpg/425px-N7753s_cropped.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"7752","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinPair","classe":"I...","rightAsc":"23:46:58","declination":"29 27 32","distance":null,"magnitudo":12.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"F, S, lE, p 7753","id1":"UGC 12779","id2":"MCG 5-56-4","id3":"MK 1134","notes":"4ZW 165, KCPG 591A","overview":"NGC 7752 and NGC 7753 are a set of galaxies approximately 272 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus.\n\nNGC 7753 is the primary galaxy.

This spectacular nebula consists largely of glowing gases from the star's outer layers ejected during the final stages of its life when it had run out of the fuel necessary to sustain its core fusion processes. The remnants of its core will remain as a white dwarf. \nIt is often cited as a member of the open cluster NGC 2818A framing it, however, radial velocity differences between the planetary nebula and open cluster suggest a chance alignment. The case is an example of a superimposed pair, similar to NGC 2438 and M46.\nPartly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion. Consequently, open clusters tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically some 10 million years, because of external gravitational influences amid other factors. Under exceptional conditions, open clusters can remain intact for up to 100 million years.\nTheoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between 8 and 1 solar masses, which puts their age at 40 million years and older. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a member of an open cluster in a planetary nebula phase. One such reason is that the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars belonging to younger clusters is on the order of thousands of years - a blink of the eye in cosmic terms. Only one association has been established between open clusters and nearby nebulae, the extremely distant nebula PHR 1315-6555"},{"id":2261,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2261"}],"constelation":"mon","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2261?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Ngc2261.jpg/391px-Ngc2261.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Ngc2261.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Ngc2261.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Ngc2261.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Ngc2261.jpg/391px-Ngc2261.jpg"},{"thumb":"/media/images/ngc2261.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/ngc2261.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/ngc2261.jpg","name":"","photo":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/images/ngc2261.jpg","photo_url":"","photo_thumbnail":""}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2261","otype":"Star","type":"Herbig Ae/Be star","type_shortcut":"Ae*","classe":"EN+RN","rightAsc":"06:39:09","declination":"08 44 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":12.5,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"B, vmE 330deg , N com =*11","id1":"LBN 920","id2":" ","id3":"Hubble's variable nebula","notes":"","overview":"NGC 2261 (also known as Hubble's Variable Nebula or Caldwell 46) is a variable nebula located in the constellation Monoceros.

The Pelican Nebula is located nearby first magnitude star Deneb, and is divided from its more prominent neighbour, the North America Nebula, by a molecular cloud filled with dark dust.\nThe Pelican is much studied because it has a particularly active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds. The light from young energetic stars is slowly transforming cold gas to hot and causing an ionization front gradually to advance outward. Particularly dense filaments of cold gas are seen to still remain, and among these are found two jets emitted from the HerbigâHaro object 555.

As seen from the Earth, it is inclined by an angle of 18Â° to the line of sight along a position angle of 145Â°. The morphological classification in the De Vaucouleurs system is SA(s)d, indicating a pure spiral structure with loosely wound arms. However, optical images of the galaxy indicate the presence of a weak bar structure spanning an angle of 12? across the nucleus.

The supernova occurred approximately 5000 years ago from our point of view. In 1998 a pulsar (named PSR J0537-6910) was discovered with the very fast rotation period of 16 milliseconds and the same approximate age as the supernova remnant. VFTS 102 is a runaway blue supergiant found with NGC 2060, which is proposed to be a companion of the pulsar ejected at the time of the supernova explosion.\nNGC 2060 has been identified as one of the few locations for OVz stars, stars with unusually strong HeII 468.6 nm absorption indicative of weak stellar winds and relatively low luminosity for the class.

It was discovered in 1785 by the British astronomer Frederick William Herschel I, who catalogued it as a bright, nebulous patch. The brightest galaxy within the northern Coma Cluster, it is located at a distance of 94 million parsecs (308 million light years) from Earth. Unlike a flattened, disc-shaped spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, NGC 4889 has no visible dust lanes or spiral arms and has a smooth, featureless, egg-shaped profile that diminishes in luminosity with distance from the center. At the core of the galaxy is a supermassive black hole that heats up the intracluster medium through the action of friction from infalling gases and dust. The X-ray emission from the galaxy extends out to several million light years of the cluster.\nAs with other similar elliptical galaxies, only a fraction of the mass of NGC 4889 is in the form of stars.

The brightest galaxy within the northern Coma Cluster, it is located at a distance of 94 million parsecs (308 million light years) from Earth. Unlike a flattened, disc-shaped spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, NGC 4889 has no visible dust lanes or spiral arms and has a smooth, featureless, egg-shaped profile that diminishes in luminosity with distance from the center. At the core of the galaxy is a supermassive black hole that heats up the intracluster medium through the action of friction from infalling gases and dust. The X-ray emission from the galaxy extends out to several million light years of the cluster.\nAs with other similar elliptical galaxies, only a fraction of the mass of NGC 4889 is in the form of stars. They have a flattened, unequal distribution that bulges within its edge. Between the stars is a dense interstellar medium full of heavy elements emitted by evolved stars.

This galaxy was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier on February 19, 1771. Messier 49 is positioned 4.1Â° west-southwest of the star Epsilon Virginis.\r\nAs an elliptical galaxy, Messier 49 has the physical form of a radio galaxy, but it only has the radio emission of a normal galaxy. From the detected radio emission, the core region is emitting roughly 1053 erg (1046 J or 1022 YJ) of energy. The nucleus of this galaxy is emitting X-rays, suggests the likely presence of a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 5.65 Ă 108 solar masses, or 565 million times the mass of the Sun. X-ray emissions shows a structure to the north of Messier 49 that resembles a bow shock. To the southwest of the core, the luminous outline of the galaxy can be traced out to a distance of 260 kpc. The only supernova event observed within this galaxy is SN 1969Q, discovered in June 1969.\r\nThis galaxy has a large collection of globular clusters, estimated at about 5,900. However, this count is far exceeded by the 13,450 globular clusters orbiting the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. On average, the globular clusters of M 49 are about 10 billion years old. Between 2000â2009, strong evidence for stellar mass black hole was discovered in an M 49 cluster. A second candidate was announced in 2011.\r\nMessier 49 was the first member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies to be discovered. It is the most luminous member of that cluster and more luminous than any galaxy closer to the Earth. This galaxy forms part of the smaller Virgo B subcluster located 4.5Â° away from the dynamic center of the Virgo Cluster, centered on Messier 87. Messier 49 is gravitationally interacting with the dwarf irregular galaxy UGC 7636. The dwarf shows a trail of debris spanning roughly 1 Ă 5 arcminutes, which corresponds to a physical dimension of 30 Ă 6 kpc."},{"id":5679,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5679"}],"constelation":"vir","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5679?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg/692px-NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg/692px-NGC_5679_Arp_274HST.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"5679","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Interacting Galaxies","type_shortcut":"IG","classe":"4","rightAsc":"14:35:08","declination":"05 21 32","distance":null,"magnitudo":13.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"","id1":"ARP 274","id2":"VV 458","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"The NGC 5679 group, also known as Arp 274, is a triplet of galaxies, MCG+1-37-36, MCG+1-37-35 and MCG+1-37-34, spanning about 200 000 light-years and at some 400 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo.\nThis image was produced by Hubble's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, and is a blend of blue, visible, infrared and hydrogen emissions.

The two bright stars immediately above the galaxy on the right are actually located much closer, in fact they are in our own galaxy.\nThe name \"Arp 274\" derives from being included in an Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies drawn up by Halton Arp in the years from 1962 through 1967 and published by the California Institute of Technology.\nThe redshifts of the three components of this system are: left 7483kps, central 8654kps, and right 7618kps. By conventional interpretation left and right are of the same order of distance, with the centre component substantially further (17 - 23 Mpc).\nAlthough the galaxies were previously thought to be interacting gravitationally, the newer Hubble image shows little evidence for this.

The galaxy is one of the few elliptical galaxies proven to have significant amounts of dark matter. Large amounts of dark matter are necessary to prevent the gas from escaping the galaxy; the visible mass clearly is not large enough to hold such an extensive gas halo. The dark matter halo is estimated to have 10 times the mass of the stars in the galaxy.\nNGC 4555 is important because of its isolation. Most elliptical galaxies are found in the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies, and almost all those for which dark matter estimates are available are located in the centres of these larger systems. In these circumstances it impossible to know whether the dark matter is associated with the galaxy or the surrounding cluster.

Members of the Coma cluster, it is a possibility that both galaxies have experienced collision, and will continue colliding until they coalesce.\r\nThe colors of the galaxy are peculiar. In the upper galaxy (NGC 4676A, to the right in the photo), a core with some dark markings is surrounded by a bluish white remnant of spiral arms. The tail is unusual, starting out blue and terminating in a more yellowish color, despite the fact that the beginning of each arm in virtually every spiral galaxy starts yellow and terminates in a bluish color. The lower galaxy (NGC 4676B, to the left) is closer to normal, with a yellowish core and two arcs; arm remnants underneath are bluish as well.\r\nThe galaxies were photographed in 2002 by the Hubble Space Telescope."},{"id":4501,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4501"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"41517"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"88"}],"constelation":"com","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4501?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/M88s.jpg/505px-M88s.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/M88s.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/M88s.jpg","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/M88s.jpg","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/M88s.jpg/505px-M88s.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/NGC_4501.png/342px-NGC_4501.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/NGC_4501.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/NGC_4501.png","name":"","photo":null,"photo_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/NGC_4501.png","photo_thumbnail":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/NGC_4501.png/342px-NGC_4501.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4501","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert 2 Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert_2","classe":"SA(rs)b","rightAsc":"12:31:59","declination":"14 25 13","distance":null,"magnitudo":14.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"B, vL, vmE; = M88","id1":"UGC 7675","id2":"MCG 3-32-59","id3":"ZWG 99.76, VCC 1401","notes":"","overview":"Messier 88 (also known as M88 or NGC 4501) is a spiral galaxy about 50 to 60 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices.

It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre MĂŠchain on February 16, 1781. When William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, observed the nebula in 1848, his hand-drawn illustration resembled an owl's head. It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.\r\nThe nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20â30% larger than the inner shell. The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45Â° to the line of sight.\r\nThe nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses of matter, including hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per cubic centimeter. Its outer radius is around 0.91 ly (0.28 pc) and it is expanding with velocities in the range of 27â39 km/s into the surrounding interstellar medium.\r\nThe 14th magnitude central star has since reached the turning point of its evolution where it condenses to form a white dwarf. It has 55â60% of the Sun's mass, 41â148 times the brightness of the Sun, and an effective temperature of 123,000 K.
