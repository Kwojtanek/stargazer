The celestial entity has several meanings in different cultures and traditions.\nThe cluster is dominated by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing.

It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. Being approximately 220,000 light years across, it is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 44 other smaller galaxies.\r\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is the most massive galaxy in the Local Group as well. Despite earlier findings that suggested that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the most massive in the grouping, the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion (1012) stars: at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way, which is estimated to be 200â400 billion.\r\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5Ă1012 solar masses, while the mass of the Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5Ă1011 solar masses. In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and M31 are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy. The Milky Way and Andromeda are expected to collide in 3.75 billion years, eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy  or perhaps a large disk galaxy.\r\nAt 3.4, the apparent magnitude of the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the brightest of any of the Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution. Although it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye or when viewed using binoculars or a small telescope, making it appear similar to a star."},{"id":6405,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6405"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"6"}],"constelation":"sco","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6405?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/m6_eguivar_1600.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/m6_eguivar_1600.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/m6_eguivar_1600.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6405","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"III2p","rightAsc":"17:40:20","declination":"-32 01 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":4.5,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, L, iR, lC, st 7, 10...; = M6","id1":"OCL 1030","id2":"ESO 455-SC30","id3":"Butterfly cluster","notes":"","overview":"The Butterfly Cluster (cataloged as Messier 6 or M6, and as NGC 6405) is an open cluster of stars in the constellation of Scorpius.

It was probably discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. Messier described it as, \"A cluster of small stars a little below the parallel of ? (Andromedae). In an ordinary telescope of 3 feet one can distinguish the stars.\"\r\nBased on the distance modulus of 8.38, this cluster is located at a distance of about 470 parsecs, or 1,500 light years. For stars in the range from 0.12 to 1.0 solar masses, M34 contains an estimated 400 members. It spans about 35' on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7 light years. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, well away from city lights. It is possible to see it in binoculars when light pollution is limited.\r\nThe age of this cluster lies between the respective ages of the Pleiades open cluster at 100 million years and the Hyades open cluster at 800 million years. Comparisons between the observed stellar spectra and the values predicted by stellar evolutionary models gives an age estimate of 200â250 million years for M34. This is roughly the age at which stars with 0.5 solar masses enter the main sequence. By comparison, stars like the Sun enter the main sequence after 30 million years.\r\nThe average proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is termed the metallicity by astronomers. This is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen, compared to the same proportion in the Sun. For M34, the metallicity has a value of [Fe/H] = +0.07 Âą 0.04. This is equivalent to a 17% higher proportion of iron compared to the Sun. Other elements show a similar abundance, with the exception of nickel which is underabundant.\r\nAt least 19 members of this cluster are white dwarfs. These are stellar remnants of progenitor stars of up to eight solar masses that have evolved through the main sequence and are no longer engaged in thermonuclear fusion to generate energy. Seventeen of the white dwarfs are of spectral type DA or DAZ, while one is a type DB and the last is a type DC.\r\n^ a b c d e Jones, Kenneth Glyn (1991). Messier's nebulae and star clusters.

Identification of the cluster's unusually large variable star population was begun in 1913 by American astronomer Solon Irving Bailey and new variable members continue to be identified up through 2004.\r\n\r\nMany amateur astronomers consider it one of the finest northern globular clusters, following only Messier 13. M3 has an apparent magnitude of 6.2, making it a difficult naked eye target even with dark conditions. With a moderate-sized telescope, the cluster is fully defined. It can be a challenge to locate through the technique of star hopping, but can be found by looking almost exactly halfway along an imaginary line connecting the bright star Arcturus to Cor Caroli. Using a telescope with a 25 cm (9.8 in) aperture, the cluster has a bright core with a diameter of about 6 arcminutes and spans a total of 12 arcminutes.\r\nThis cluster is one of the largest and brightest, and is made up of around 500,000 stars. It is estimated to be 8 billion years old.

It contains 274 known variable stars; by far the highest number found in any globular cluster. These include 133 RR Lyrae variables, of which about a third display the Blazhko effect of long-period modulation. The overall abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is in the range of â1.34 to â1.50 dex. This value gives the logarithm of the abundance relative to the Sun; the actual proportion is 3.2â4.6% of the solar abundance.

It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode in 1777, then published in the Jahrbuch during 1779. The cluster was independently rediscovered by Charles Messier on March 18, 1781 and added as the 92nd entry in his catalogue. M92 is at a distance of about 26,700 light-years away from Earth.\nM92 is one of the brighter globular clusters in the northern hemisphere, but it is often overlooked by amateur astronomers because of its proximity to the even more spectacular Messier 13. It is visible to the naked eye under very good conditions.\nAmong the Milky Way population of globular clusters, Messier 92 is among the brighter clusters in terms of absolute magnitude. It is also one of the oldest clusters. Messier 92 is located around 16Ă10^3 ly (4.9 kpc) above the galactic plane and 33Ă10^3 ly (10 kpc) from the Galactic Center. The heliocentric distance of Messier 92 is 26.7Ă10^3 ly (8.2 kpc). The half-light radius, or radius containing half of the light emission from the cluster, is 1.09 arcminutes, while the tidal radius is 15.17 arcminutes. It appears only slightly flattened, with the minor axis being about 89% Âą 3% as large as the major axis.\nCharacteristic of other globulars, Messier 92 has a very low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium; what astronomers term its metallicity. Relative to the Sun, the abundance of iron in the cluster is given by [Fe/H] = â2.29 dex, which equates to only 0.5% of the solar abundance. This puts the estimated age range for the cluster at 14.2 Âą 1.2 billion years, or roughly the age of the Universe.\nThe cluster is not currently in a state of core collapse and the core radius is about 2 arcseconds. It is an Oosterhoff type II (OoII) globular cluster, which means it belongs to the group of metal poor clusters with longer period RR Lyrae variable stars. The 1997 Catalogue of Variable Stars in Globular Clusters listed 28 candidate variable stars in the cluster, although only 20 have been confirmed. As of 2001, there are 17 known RR Lyrae variables in Messier 92. 10 X-ray sources have been detected within the 1.02 arcminute half-mass radius of the cluster, of which half are candidate cataclysmic variable stars."},{"id":2546,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2546"}],"constelation":"pup","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2546?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2546","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"III2m","rightAsc":"08:12:15","declination":"-37 35 07","distance":null,"magnitudo":6.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, B, L, lC, iE, st 9...12","id1":"OCL 726","id2":"ESO 369-SC7","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 2546 is an open cluster in the constellation Puppis, discovered by Abbe Lacaille in 1751-1752 from South Africa."},{"id":5,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"595"}],"constelation":"and","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5?format=json","photos":[],"fov":0.1286,"unique_name":"5","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Galaxy","classe":"E:","rightAsc":"00:07:48","declination":"35 21 44","distance":null,"magnitudo":6.5,"dimAxb":"0.643 x 0.515","pa":115,"description":"vF, vS, N = *13, 14","id1":"UGC 62","id2":"MCG 41426","id3":"ZWG 517.17","notes":"NPM1G +35.0003","overview":"NGC 5 (also MCG 6-1-13, UGC 62 and PGC 595) is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Andromeda.

This corresponds with a core region densely populated with stars around 1.3 light years in diameter, which indicates it has undergone core collapse. The cluster lies around 13,000 light years distant and is one of the closer globular clusters to Earth. It also lies 17,000 light years away from the galactic centre. It belongs to ShapleyâSawyer Concentration Class VI, namely of intermediate density, and has been calculated to be 11.78 billion years old. There are a large number of binary stars in the system, as well as blue stragglers, which are likely to have been formed by collisions and mergers of smaller stars. The NASA website \"Astronomy Picture of the Day\" notes that it holds over 100 thousand stars in a sphere about 100 light-years in diameter.\nThe apparent magnitude of the cluster is 5.4, so it can be seen with the unaided eye. However this depends on good viewing conditions with a minimum of light pollution. With binoculars it can be seen to cover an area three quarters the size of the full moon. It lies 1.5 degrees east of 5th magnitude Omega Pavonis.

The object was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier on May 29, 1764, who cataloged it as number 10 in his catalogue and described it as a \"nebula without stars\". In 1774, German astronomer Johann Elert Bode likewise called it a \"nebulous patch without stars; very pale\". Using larger instrumentation, German-born astronomer William Herschel was able to resolve the cluster into its individual members. He described it as a \"beautiful cluster of extremely compressed stars\". William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse thought he could distinguish a dark lane through part of the cluster. The first to estimate the distance to the cluster was Harlow Shapley, although his derivation of 33,000 light years was much further than the modern value.\n\nThe tidal radius of M10 is 19.3 arcminutes, which is about two-thirds of the apparent diameter of the Moon. Viewed through medium-sized telescopes it appears about half that size (8â9 arcminutes), as its bright core is only 35 light-years across. It has a core radius of 48 arcseconds and a half-mass radius of 147 arcseconds (2.5 arcminutes). M10 has a spatial diameter of 83 light-years and is estimated to be 14,300 light-years away from Earth.\nIn terms of the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, Messier 10 is \"moderately metalâpoor\". The abundance of iron, measured as [Fe/H] equals â1.45 Âą 0.04 dex, is only 3.5% of the abundance found at the surface of the Sun. The cluster shows evidence of being enriched by the elements generated through the s-process in massive stars and Type II supernovae. It shows little evidence of enrichment by Type 1a supernovae.\nBecause binary stars are, on average, more massive than normal stars, the binaries tend to migrate toward the center of the cluster. The fraction of binary stars in the core region is about 14%. This proportion decreases with increasing radius to about 1.5% in the outlying regions of the cluster. Correspondingly, the core region contains a concentration of interaction-formed blue straggler stars, most of which formed 2â5 billion years ago. The density of stars in the core region is about 3.8 solar masses per cubic parsec. Four variable stars have been discovered in this cluster.\nThe cluster is currently located about 5 kiloparsecs (16 kly) from the Galactic Center.

The structure in the nebula is among the most complex ever observed in planetary nebulae. The spectrum of NGC 6302 shows that its central star is one of the hottest stars in the galaxy, with a surface temperature in excess of 200,000 K, implying that the star from which it formed must have been very large (cf. PG 1159 star).\r\nThe central star, a white dwarf, was only recently discovered (Szyszka et al. 2009), using the upgraded Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The star has a current mass of around 0.64 solar masses. It is surrounded by a particularly dense equatorial disc composed of gas and dust. This dense disc is postulated to have caused the star's outflows to form a bipolar structure (Gurzadyan 1997) similar to an hour-glass. This bipolar structure shows many interesting features seen in planetary nebulae such as ionization walls, knots and sharp edges to the lobes."},{"id":2467,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2467"}],"constelation":"pup","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2467?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/A_cosmic_concoction_in_NGC_2467.jpg/410px-A_cosmic_concoction_in_NGC_2467.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/A_cosmic_concoction_in_NGC_2467.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/A_cosmic_concoction_in_NGC_2467.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/NGC_2467_and_Surroundings.jpg/400px-NGC_2467_and_Surroundings.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/NGC_2467_and_Surroundings.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/NGC_2467_and_Surroundings.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2467","otype":"Interstellar matter","type":"HII (ionized) region","type_shortcut":"HII","classe":"OCL+EN","rightAsc":"07:52:18","declination":"-26 25 07","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.1,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"","id1":"OCL 668","id2":"ESO 493-SC25","id3":"LBN 1065","notes":"","overview":"NGC 2467 is a star-forming region, popularly known as the \"Skull and Crossbones nebula,\" whose appearance has occasionally also been likened to that of a colorful mandrill.

In the New General Catalogue, compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a \"remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval.\" This cluster can be easily viewed with a pair of 10Ă50 binoculars, forming a patch of hazy light some 4 arcminutes wide that is slightly elongated along the east-west axis. With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12 arcminutes across with a compressed core one arcminute wide. It is best observed around August.\nM30 is located at a distance of about 27,100 light-years from Earth, and is about 93 light-years across. The estimated age is roughly 12.93 billion years and it has a combined mass of about 160,000 times the mass of the Sun. The cluster is following a retrograde orbit through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a satellite galaxy rather than forming within the Milky Way. It is currently located at a distance of about 22.2 kly (6.8 kpc) from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated 26 kly (8.0 kpc) for the Sun.\nThe M30 cluster has passed through a dynamic process called core collapse and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the Sun's mass per cubic parsec. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create binary star systems, as well as a type of star called a blue straggler that is formed by mass transfer. A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster."},{"id":6613,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6613"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"18"}],"constelation":"sgr","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6613?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/M18.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/M18.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/M18.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6613","otype":"Composite object","type":"Open (galactic) Cluster","type_shortcut":"OpCl","classe":"II3pn","rightAsc":"18:19:58","declination":"-17 00 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.2,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"Cl, P, vlC; = M18","id1":"OCL 40","id2":"","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"Messier 18 or M18 (also designated NGC 6613) is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius.

Trumpler 1930) or 4,000 light years (the latter from Kenneth Glyn Jones and the Sky Catalogue 2000.0). The Night Sky Observer's Guide by Kepple and Sanner gives a deviating value of 6,000 light years â the uncertainty due to inaccurately known absorption of the cluster's light.\r\nAccording to the Sky Catalog 2000, M29 is included in the Cygnus OB1 association, and approaching us at 28 km/s. Its age is estimated at 10 million years, as its five hottest stars are all giants of spectral class B0. The Night Sky Observer's Guide gives the apparent brightness of the brightest star as 8.59 visual magnitudes. The absolute magnitude may be an impressive -8.2 mag, or a luminosity of 160,000 Suns. The linear diameter was estimated at only 11 light years. Its Trumpler class is III,3,p,n (as it is associated with nebulosity), although GĂśtz gives, differently, II,3,m, and Kepple/Sanner gives I,2,m,n. The Sky Catalogue 2000.0 lists it with 50 member stars; earlier Becvar gave only the number of 20 members.\r\nThis cluster can be seen in binoculars. In telescopes, lowest powers are best. The brightest stars of M29 form a \"stubby dipper\", as Mallas says it. The four brightest stars form a quadrilateral, and another three, a triangle north of them. It is often known as the \"cooling tower\" due to its resemblance to the hyperboloid-shaped structures. A few fainter stars are around them, but the cluster appears quite isolated, especially in smaller telescopes. In photographs, a large number of very faint Milky Way background stars shows up.\r\nM29 can be found quite easily as it is about 1.7 degrees South and little East of Gamma or 37 Cygni (Sadr).

Eggen surveyed the cluster in 1968, concluding that the brightest star in the field, magnitude-8.96 HD 56847, is likely to lie in the field and not a true member of the cluster. He also identified one or possibly two blue stragglers. These are unexpectedly hot and luminous stars that appear younger than surrounding stars, and have likely developed by sucking matter off companion stars. Four are now recognised to be in the cluster. By analysing the masses of the smallest stars that have evolved into red giantsânamely, stars of 1.8 or 1.9 solar massesâSwiss astronomers Jean-Claude Mermilliod and Michel Mayor were able to date the age of the cluster at 2.2 billion years.

The brightest members of the cluster can be viewed with binoculars. Although the listed visual magnitude is 7.1, several observers have reported higher estimates.\nAfter adjusting for reddening due to interstellar dust, the distance modulus is estimated as 11.6 magnitudes. It is located about 2,100 parsecs distant with an estimated age of 20â25 million years. This means that stars of spectral class B2 or higher (in the sense of higher mass), are reaching the end of their main sequence lifespan. This cluster appears to be located in front of a molecular cloud, although the two are not physically associated. This cloud has the effect of blocking background stars from the visual image of the cluster as it lies at a distance of 300 parsecs.\nThis cluster is of interest because of the high number of Be stars, with a total of about 24 discovered. These are spectral class B stars that show prominent emission lines of hydrogen in their spectrum. Most of the Be stars in the cluster lie between spectral class B0 and B3. A candidate member of the cluster, LS I +61Â° 235, is a Be star with an X-ray binary component that has a period of about three years. There are at least five blue stragglers in the cluster.

M67's Trumpler class is variously given as II 2 r, II 2 m, or II 3 r. It was discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in 1779. Age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years, with the most recent estimate (4 Gyr) implying stars in M67 are younger than the Sun. Distance estimates are likewise varied and typically range between 800â900 pc. Recent estimates of 855, 840, and 815 pc were established via binary star modelling and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting, accordingly.\r\nM67 is not the oldest known open cluster, but there are few Galactic clusters known to be older, and none of those are as close as M67. M67 is an important laboratory for studying stellar evolution, since the cluster is well populated, obscured by negligible amounts of soot, and all its stars are at the same distance and age, except for approximately 30 anomalous blue stragglers, whose origins are not fully understood.\r\nM67 is the nearest old open cluster, and thus has become a standard example for studying stellar evolution. It is probably the second best observed open cluster after the Hyades cluster, which is amongst the nearest open clusters and younger than M67. M67 is one of the most-studied open clusters, yet estimates of its physical parameters such as age, mass, and number of stars of a given type, vary substantially. Richer et al. estimate its age to be 4 Gyr, its mass to be 1080 solar masses, and the number of white dwarfs to be 150. Hurley et al. estimate its current mass to be 1400 solar masses and its initial mass to be approximately 10 times as great.\r\nM67 has more than 100 stars similar to the Sun, and countless red giants. The total star count has been estimated at well over 500. The ages and prevalence of Sun-like stars contained within the cluster had led astronomers to consider M67 as the possible parent cluster of our own Sun. However, computer simulations have suggested that this is highly unlikely to be the case.\r\nThe cluster contains no main sequence stars bluer than spectral type F, other than perhaps some of the blue stragglers, since the brighter stars of that age have already left the main sequence. In fact, when the stars of the cluster are plotted on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, there is a distinct \"turn-off\" representing the stars which have terminated hydrogen fusion in the core and are destined to become red giants. As the cluster ages, the turn-off moves progressively down the main sequence.\r\n\r\nIt appears that M67 does not contain an unbiased sample of stars. One cause of this is mass segregation, the process by which lighter stars (actually, systems) gain speed at the expense of more massive stars during close encounters, which causes the lighter stars to be at a greater average distance from the center of the cluster or to escape altogether"},{"id":6624,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6624"}],"constelation":"sgr","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6624?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/NGC_6624_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/400px-NGC_6624_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/NGC_6624_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/NGC_6624_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6624","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"VI","rightAsc":"18:23:40","declination":"-30 21 39","distance":null,"magnitudo":7.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"glob. cl. , vB, pL, R,rrr, st 16","id1":"GCL 93","id2":"ESO 457-SC11","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 6624 is a globular cluster in the constellation Sagittarius.

However, modern photometric photometry has detected a short \"horizontal branch\" in the H-R diagram of M71, which is characteristic of a globular cluster. The shortness of the branch explains the lacking of the RR Lyrae variables and is due to the globular's relatively young age of 9-10 billion years.

It was discovered in 1826 by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop from his home in Parramatta, in New South Wales, Australia. There is considerable debate in the literature regarding the galaxy's fundamental properties such as its Hubble type (lenticular galaxy or a giant elliptical galaxy) and distance (10â16 million light-years). NGC 5128 is one of the closest radio galaxies to Earth, so its active galactic nucleus has been extensively studied by professional astronomers. The galaxy is also the fifth brightest in the sky, making it an ideal amateur astronomy target, although the galaxy is only visible from low northern latitudes and the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe center of the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole with a mass equivalent to 55 million solar masses, which ejects a relativistic jet that is responsible for emissions in the X-ray and radio wavelengths. By taking radio observations of the jet separated by a decade, astronomers have determined that the inner parts of the jet are moving at about one half of the speed of light. X-rays are produced farther out as the jet collides with surrounding gases resulting in the creation of highly energetic particles. The radio jets of Centaurus A are over a million light years long.\r\nLike other starburst galaxies, a collision is suspected to be responsible for the intense burst of star formation. Models have suggested that Centaurus A was a large elliptical galaxy which collided and merged with a smaller spiral galaxy."},{"id":4372,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4372"}],"constelation":"mus","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4372?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/NGC_4372_in_Musca.jpg/434px-NGC_4372_in_Musca.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/NGC_4372_in_Musca.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/NGC_4372_in_Musca.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4372","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"XII","rightAsc":"12:25:45","declination":"-72 39 32","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.2,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"glob. cl. , pF, L, R, st 12...16","id1":"GCL 19","id2":"ESO 64-SC6","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"NGC 4372 is a globular cluster in the southern constellation of Musca."},{"id":53,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"53"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"982"}],"constelation":"tuc","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/53?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"53","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Galaxy","classe":"SBb","rightAsc":"00:14:42","declination":"-60 19 42","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.2,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"eF, S, R, bM","id1":"ESO 111-20","id2":"FAI R 3","id3":"AM 0012-603","notes":"","overview":"NGC 53 is a barred spiral galaxy with a ring in the constellation Tucana.

It is not, as its name might suggest, in Cancer. The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.\nAt an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn's moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about 2.0 kiloparsecs (6,500 ly) from Earth. It has a diameter of 3.4 parsecs (11 ly), corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometres per second (930 mi/s), or 0.5% c.\nAt the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star 28â30 kilometres (17â19 mi) across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, which emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab is generally the strongest persistent source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula's radiation allows for the detailed studying of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun's corona was mapped from observations of the Crab's radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula."},{"id":2997,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"2997"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"27978"}],"constelation":"ant","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/2997?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"/media/images/ngc2997.410x230.jpg","normal":"/media/images/ngc2997.1280x718.jpg","orginal":"/media/images/ngc2997.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"2997","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"SAB(rs)c","rightAsc":"09:45:38","declination":"-31 11 27","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"! vF, vL, vgvsbMN 4\", 19s .5 d","id1":"ESO 434-35","id2":"MCG -40","id3":"UGCA 181","notes":"AM 0943-305","overview":"NGC 2997 is a face-on unbarred spiral galaxy about 40 million light-years away in the constellation Antlia.

A telescope with a 150mm primary mirror is required to resolve the stars within this irregularly shaped cluster. The cluster NGC 6362, what's known as a globular cluster, was observed by the Wide Field Imager attached to the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. The resulting photo shows tens of thousands of very ancient stars, along with a good amount of stars passing off younger than they actually are. Tightly bound by gravity, globular clusters are composed of old stars, which, are around 10 billion years old, and much older than the sun. These clusters are fairly common. there are more than 150 currently known in our galaxy, the Milky Way, and more which have been spotted in other galaxies. All stars are usually around the same age in a given cluster. Most of the stars inside the cluster are thought to have formed at or around the same time and are thought to be of similar age. Most of the stars inside NGC 6362 are red giants that appear yellow and aged, however, you also see a number of so-called blue stragglers, stars that appear younger than their true age. Blue stars are hot and consume their fuel quickly.\nThese stars are bluer, more luminous and more massive than they should be after 10 billion years of stellar evolution, and if they had truly formed that long ago, they should have already died. There are only 2 possible explanations for these stars to be the color that they are, and shine as bright as they do and those are; these stars have either stolen mass from companion stars, or are the result of mergers between two stars that collided. NGC 6362 is located about 25 000 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ara (The Altar). British astronomer James Dunlop first observed this globular cluster on 30 June 1826.Believe it or not these clusters are showing up all over the our galaxy and in a lot of other surrounding galaxies. As we continue to find out more about these cluster we will come up with more ways that these blue stragglers have shown up in these otherwise ancient clusters."},{"id":1532,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"1532"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"14638"}],"constelation":"eri","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/1532?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/ESO_-_Ngc1532_gendler_%28by%29.jpg/440px-ESO_-_Ngc1532_gendler_%28by%29.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/ESO_-_Ngc1532_gendler_%28by%29.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/ESO_-_Ngc1532_gendler_%28by%29.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"1532","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"Sbc","rightAsc":"04:12:04","declination":"-32 52 27","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"B, vL, vmE 32deg , psmbM","id1":"ESO 359-27","id2":"MCG -18","id3":"AM 0410-330","notes":"AM 0410-325, IRAS04102-3259","overview":"NGC 1532 is an edge-on barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Eridanus.

It was discovered by Charles Messier on January 19, 1779. The cluster is located almost midway along an imaginary line between Albireo (? Cygni) and Sulafat (? Lyrae). It is a challenge to find with large (50â80 mm) binoculars, appearing as a slightly fuzzy star. The cluster can be resolved using a telescope with an aperture of 8 in (20 cm) or larger.\nM56 is at a distance of about 32,900 light-years from Earth and measures roughly 84 light-years across, with a combined mass some 230,000 times that of the Sun. It is about 31â32 kly (9.5â9.8 kpc) from the Galactic Center and 4.8 kly (1.5 kpc) above the galactic plane. This cluster has an estimated age of 13.70 billion years and is following a retrograde orbit through the Milky Way. The properties of this cluster suggest that it may have been acquired during the merger of a dwarf galaxy, of which Omega Centauri forms the surviving nucleus. For Messier 56, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, has a very low value of [Fe/H] = â2.00 dex. This is equivalent to 1% of the abundance in the Sun.\nThe brightest stars in M56 are of 13th magnitude, while it contains only about a dozen known variable stars, such as V6 (RV Tauri star; period: 90 days) or V1 (Cepheid: 1.510 days); other variable stars are V2 (irregular) and V3 (semiregular). In 2000, a diffuse X-ray emission was tentatively identified coming from the vicinity of the cluster. This is most likely interstellar medium that has been heated by the passage of the cluster through the galactic halo. The relative velocity of the cluster is about 177 km s?1, which is sufficient to heat the medium in its wake to a temperature of 940,000 K."},{"id":5024,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5024"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"53"}],"constelation":"com","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5024?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Messier_53_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg/400px-Messier_53_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Messier_53_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Messier_53_Hubble_WikiSky.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"5024","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"V","rightAsc":"13:12:55","declination":"18 10 00","distance":null,"magnitudo":8.9,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"!, glob. cl. , B, vC, iR, vvmbM, st 12; = M53","id1":"GCL 22","id2":"","id3":"","notes":"","overview":"Messier 53 (also known as M53 or NGC 5024) is a globular cluster in the Coma Berenices constellation.

It also has many dark lanes of dust that occlude its complete starlight.\nThe discovery of NGC 134 is often attributed to Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope,but he did note that it might have been the 590th object discovered by James Dunlop in his 1828 publication, six years prior to Herschel's own observations.\nSupernova 2009gj in NGC 134 was discovered in 2009 by a farmer in New Zealand."},{"id":1433,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"1433"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"13586"}],"constelation":"hor","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/1433?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/A_galaxy_with_a_glowing_heart.jpg/469px-A_galaxy_with_a_glowing_heart.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/A_galaxy_with_a_glowing_heart.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/A_galaxy_with_a_glowing_heart.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Composite_view_of_the_galaxy_NGC_1433_from_ALMA_and_Hubble.jpg/400px-Composite_view_of_the_galaxy_NGC_1433_from_ALMA_and_Hubble.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Composite_view_of_the_galaxy_NGC_1433_from_ALMA_and_Hubble.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Composite_view_of_the_galaxy_NGC_1433_from_ALMA_and_Hubble.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/NGC1433-hst-R814GB450.jpg/400px-NGC1433-hst-R814GB450.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/NGC1433-hst-R814GB450.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/NGC1433-hst-R814GB450.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"1433","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"(R)SB(r)ab","rightAsc":"03:42:01","declination":"-47 13 19","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"vB, L, pmE, vsvmbM *10","id1":"ESO 249-14","id2":"AM 0340-472","id3":"IRAS03404-4722","notes":"","overview":"NGC 1433 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation of Dorado.

M32 is a satellite galaxy of the famous Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and was discovered by Le Gentil in 1749. M32 measures only 6.5 Âą 0.2 thousand light-years  in diameter at the widest point. Like most elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly older faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past. \nThe structure and stellar content of M32 is difficult to explain by traditional galaxy formation models. Recent simulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can transform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a small spiral galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, most of the outer layers of the smaller spiral are stripped away. The central bulge of the galaxy is much less affected and retains its morphology. Tidal effects trigger a massive star burst in the core, resulting in the high density of M32 observed today. There is also evidence that M32 has an outer disk. Although usually M32 is thought to be a satellite galaxy as mentioned above, recently a report suggested the possibility that M32 is actually a normal galaxy instead of a dwarf with triple distance compared with the data stated above, and actually located outside the local group with only their position on the sky overlapped."},{"id":1261,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"1261"}],"constelation":"hor","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/1261?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"1261","otype":"Composite object","type":"Globular Cluster","type_shortcut":"GlCl","classe":"II","rightAsc":"03:12:16","declination":"-55 12 58","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"glob. cl. , B, L, R, rr","id1":"GCL 5","id2":"Pal 1","id3":"ESO 155-SC11","notes":"","overview":"NGC 1261, also known as Caldwell 87, is a globular cluster in the constellation Horologium, first discovered by James Dunlop in 1826."},{"id":4594,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4594"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"42407"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"104"}],"constelation":"vir","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4594?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/M104_-_Sombrero.jpg/400px-M104_-_Sombrero.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/M104_-_Sombrero.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/M104_-_Sombrero.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/M104_ngc4594_sombrero_galaxy_hi-res.jpg/714px-M104_ngc4594_sombrero_galaxy_hi-res.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/M104_ngc4594_sombrero_galaxy_hi-res.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/M104_ngc4594_sombrero_galaxy_hi-res.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Messier_104_2MASS.jpg/323px-Messier_104_2MASS.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Messier_104_2MASS.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Messier_104_2MASS.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Phot-07c-00-fullres.jpg/613px-Phot-07c-00-fullres.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Phot-07c-00-fullres.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Phot-07c-00-fullres.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4594","otype":"Galaxy","type":"LINER-type Active Galaxy Nucleus","type_shortcut":"LINER","classe":"Sa","rightAsc":"12:39:59","declination":"-11 37 22","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"!, vB, vL, eE 92deg , vsmbMN; = M104","id1":"MCG -54","id2":"UGCA 293","id3":"Sombrero galaxy, IRAS12373-1120","notes":"","overview":"The Sombrero Galaxy (also known as Messier Object 104, M104 or NGC 4594) is an unbarred spiral galaxy in the constellation Virgo located 28 million light-years (8.6 Mpc) from Earth.

It is the only such galaxy having, as its host, a \"late-type lenticular galaxy\". It was probably formed when two galaxies collided a billion years ago. However, it may have first started as a disk galaxy that captured matter from a passing galaxy. This material could have, over time, become \"strung out\" to form a rotating ring.\nThe ring is not actually polar, but rather has an inclination from the plane of the host disk of approximately 45 degrees. The extreme number of pinkish star-forming areas that occurs along the galaxy's ring could be the result of the gravitation interaction caused by this collision. The ring is 50,000 light-years across - much broader than the disk itself - and has a greater amount of gas and star formation than the host ring. This likely indicates a very violent formation. The polar ring contains objects numbering in the hundreds. Many of these are red and blue supergiant stars. The most recently created stars in the ring were just formed approximately 7 million years ago. This indicates that the formation of these stars has been a long process and is still occurring.\nData about the dark matter halo of NGC 660 can be extracted by observing the gravitational effects of the dark matter on the disk and ring's rotation. From the core of the disk, radio waves are being emitted. The source of these waves is an area only 21 light years across. This may indicate the presence of a super-cluster of stars located within an area of cloud of gas. The region in the centre has a vast amount of star formation, so luminous that it is considered to be a starburst galaxy.\nLate in 2012, this polar-ring galaxy produced an enormous outburst having a magnitude of approximately ten times brighter than a supernova explosion. The cause is not certain, but this event may have resulted from a tremendous jet being emenating from galaxy's central black hole."},{"id":6300,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"6300"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"60001"}],"constelation":"ara","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/6300?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/NGC_6300_hst_09042_R814B450.png/400px-NGC_6300_hst_09042_R814B450.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/NGC_6300_hst_09042_R814B450.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/NGC_6300_hst_09042_R814B450.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"6300","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert 2 Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert_2","classe":"Sc","rightAsc":"17:16:59","declination":"-62 49 13","distance":null,"magnitudo":9.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"F, vL, vlE, am st, 2 stinv","id1":"ESO 101-25","id2":"VV 734","id3":"IRAS17123-6245","notes":"","overview":"NGC 6300 is a Seyfert galaxy located in the constellation Ara.

One of the most massive galaxies in the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clustersâM87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150-200 orbiting the Milky Wayâand its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.\r\nFrench astronomer Charles Messier discovered M87 in 1781, cataloguing it as a nebulous feature while searching for objects that would confuse comet hunters. The second brightest galaxy within the northern Virgo Cluster, M87 is located about 16.4 million parsecs (53.5 million light-years) from Earth. Unlike a disk-shaped spiral galaxy, M87 has no distinctive dust lanes. Instead, it has an almost featureless, ellipsoidal shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in luminosity with distance from the centre. Forming around one sixth of M87's mass, the stars in this galaxy have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution, their density decreasing with increasing distance from the core. At the core is a supermassive black hole, which forms the primary component of an active galactic nucleus. This object is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly radio waves. M87's galactic envelope extends out to a radius of about 150 kiloparsecs (490,000 light-years), where it has been truncatedâpossibly by an encounter with another galaxy.

They appear to be relatively young, moving outwards at supersonic speeds. According to Bruce Balick (University of Washington), \"some of their observed characteristics suggest that they are like sparks flung outward from the central star late in the very recent past (a thousand years ago). Yet their shapes ... seem to suggest that they are stationary, and that material ejected from the star flows past them, scraping gas from their surfaces.

It was discovered in 1878 by Ădouard Stephan, using the 31 inch reflector at Marseille Observatory. It is one of the smallest planetary nebulae, and by far the most extensively studied.\nNGC 7027 is one of the visually brightest planetary nebulae. It is about 600 years old.\nIt is unusually small, measuring only 0.2 by 0.1 light-years whereas the typical size for a planetary nebula is 1 light-year. It has a very complex shape, consisting of an elliptical region of ionized gas within a massive neutral cloud. The inner structure is surrounded by a translucent shroud of gas and dust. The nebula is shaped like a prolate ellipsoidal shell and contains a photodissociation region shaped like a \"clover leaf\". NGC 7027 is expanding at 17 kilometers per second (11 mi/s). The central regions of NGC 7027 have been found to emit X-rays, indicating very high temperatures. Surrounding the ellipsoidal nebula are a series of faint, blue concentric shells.\nIt is possible that the central white dwarf of NGC 7027 has an accretion disk that acts as a source of high temperatures. The white dwarf is believed to have a mass approximately 0.7 times the mass of the Sun and is radiating at 7,700 times the Sun's luminosity. NGC 7027 is currently in a short phase of planetary nebula evolution in which molecules in its envelope are being dissociated into their component atoms, and the atoms are being ionized.\nThe expanding halo of NGC 7027 has a mass of about three times the mass of the Sun, and is about 100 times more massive than the ionized central region. This mass loss in NGC 7027 provided important evidence that stars a few times more massive than the Sun can avoid being destroyed in supernova explosions.\nNGC 7027 has a rich and highly ionized spectrum caused by its hot central star. The nebula is rich in carbon, and is a very interesting object for the study of carbon chemistry in dense molecular material exposed to strong ultraviolet radiation. The spectrum of NGC 7027 contains fewer spectral lines from neutral molecules than is usual for planetary nebulae. This is due to the destruction of neutral molecules by intense UV radiation. The nebula contains ions of extremely high ionization potential. NGC 7027 is a promising place to look for HeH+, a molecule which is believed to exist in interstellar space, but which has never been conclusively identified. There is evidence for the presence of nanodiamond in NGC 7027.\nIt was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996. Prior to these observations, NGC 7027 was thought to be a proto-planetary nebula with the central star too cool to ionize any of the gas, but it is now known to be a planetary nebula in the earliest stage of its development. The central star is believed to have been about 3â4 times the mass of the Sun.\nDespite being so well known and studied, NGC 7027 does not have a popular name. In a 6\" telescope at around 50x it appears as a relatively bright bluish star. It is best viewed with the highest magnification possible."},{"id":3195,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"3195"}],"constelation":"cha","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/3195?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Ngc3195.jpg/407px-Ngc3195.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Ngc3195.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Ngc3195.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"3195","otype":"Interstellar matter","type":"Planetary Nebula","type_shortcut":"PN","classe":"PN","rightAsc":"10:09:20","declination":"-80 51 30","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"!

It was discovered by French astronomer Pierre MĂŠchain on March 20, 1781. After communicating his finding, French astronomer Charles Messier confirmed the finding four days later and added it to his catalogue of nebulous objects. Finding this object is extremely difficult with binoculars. With a telescope of 25.4 cm (10.0 in) aperture, the galaxy is visible as a 3 Ă 5 arcminute halo with a brighter core region.\nThis complex galaxy is inclined by an angle of about 53Â° to the line of sight from the Earth, which is oriented at a position angle of 172Â°. It is categorized as a double-barred spiral galaxy with a small inner bulge through the core along with an outer bulge. The nucleus displays a weak level of activity of the LINER2 type. Variations in ultraviolet emission from the core suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole. Estimates for the mass of this object range from 7006150000000000000?1.5Ă106 to 7007480000000000000?4.8Ă107 times the mass of the Sun.\nOn May 9, 1998 a supernova event was observed in this galaxy. Designated SN 1998bu, this was a Type Ia supernova explosion. It reached maximum light on May 21 then steadily declined in magnitude thereafter. Observations of the ejecta a year later showed that the explosion created 0.4 times the mass of the Sun worth of iron.

It belongs to the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way, which is at a distance of 168,000 light years. NGC 2080 was discovered by John Frederick William Herschel in 1834. The Ghost Head Nebula has a diameter of 50 light-years and is named for the two distinct white patches it possesses, called the \"eyes of the ghost\". The western patch, called A1, has a bubble in the center which was created by the young, massive star it contains. The eastern patch, called A2, has several young stars in a newly formed cluster, but they are still obscured by their originating dust cloud. Because neither dust cloud has dissipated due to the stellar radiation, astronomers have deduced that both sets of stars formed within the past 10,000 years. These stars together have begun to create a bubble in the nebula with their outpourings of material, called stellar wind.\nThe presence of stars also greatly influences the color of the nebula. The western portion of the nebula has a dominant oxygen emission line because of a powerful star on the nebula's outskirts; this colors it green. The rest of the nebula's outskirts have a red hue due to the ionization of hydrogen. Because both hydrogen and oxygen are ionized in the central region, which appears pale yellow; when hydrogen is energized enough to emit a second wavelength of light, it appears blue, as in the area surrounding A1 and A2.\nNGC 2080 should not be confused with the Ghost Nebula (Sh2-136) or the Little Ghost Nebula (NGC 6369)."},{"id":1058,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"1058"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"10314"}],"constelation":"per","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/1058?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/NGC_1058_-_HST09042_n2-R814GB450.png/400px-NGC_1058_-_HST09042_n2-R814GB450.png","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/NGC_1058_-_HST09042_n2-R814GB450.png","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/NGC_1058_-_HST09042_n2-R814GB450.png"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"1058","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert 2 Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert_2","classe":"SA(rs)c","rightAsc":"02:43:30","declination":"37 20 28","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"pF, cL, R, glbM","id1":"UGC 2193","id2":"MCG 37049","id3":"ZWG 524.5","notes":"KUG 0240+371","overview":"NGC 1058 is a Seyfert Type 2 galaxy in the Perseus constellation.

The nebula was originally a low-mass star that ejected its layers into space, forming the nebula. The central star is now a bright white dwarf star of apparent magnitude 11.5. The Saturn Nebula gets its name from its superficial resemblance to the planet Saturn with its rings nearly edge-on to the observer. It was so named by Lord Rosse in the 1840s, when telescopes had improved to the point that its Saturn-like shape could be discerned. William Henry Smyth said that the Saturn Nebula is one of Struve's nine \"Rare Celestial Objects.\"\r\nThe Saturn Nebula is a complex planetary nebula and contains many morphological and kinematic sub-systems in three dimensions. It includes a halo, jet-like streams, multiple shells, ansae (\"handles\"), and small-scale filaments and knots. The ansae are expanding non-radially from the central star. Although the ansae are most prominent in the Saturn Nebula, they are also visible in other planetary nebulae, including NGC 3242, NGC 6543 and NGC 2371-2.\r\nThe distance of the Saturn Nebula is not known precisely. Sabbadin et al. 2004 estimates the distance to be 5,200 light-years (1.6 kpc). In 1963 O'Dell estimated it to be 3,900 light-years (1.2 kpc), which gives an approximate diameter of 0.5 light years for the object as a whole.\r\nThe central star, a very hot bluish dwarf with a temperature of 55,000 K, from which the nebula is believed to originate, has an absolute magnitude of +1.5, which equates to a luminosity of about 20 solar luminosities and a visual magnitude of 11.5. This strong ultraviolet irradiation from the central star creates the characteristic fluorescent green tint of the nebula via the radiation of doubly ionized oxygen. The object overall has a visual magnitude of 8 and a radial velocity of 28 miles per second towards the Earth.\r\nThe nebula is 1 degree west of the star Nu Aquarii. The central portion measures 25? 17?, while the outer shell extends to 41? Ă 35?. The object is on many \"best of\" observing lists."},{"id":109,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"109"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"1633"}],"constelation":"and","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/109?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"109","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinPair","classe":"SBa","rightAsc":"00:26:14","declination":"21 48 26","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"vF, S, 3 st nr","id1":"UGC 251","id2":"MCG 43923","id3":"ZWG 479.31","notes":"KCPG 8B, NPM1G +21.0018","overview":"NGC 109 is a spiral galaxy estimated to be about 240 million light-years away in the constellation of Andromeda.

The galaxy has a diameter of about 35,000 light-years and has a very diffuse disc with almost no central bulge. Although its overall structure is quite complex, the galaxy does have a very faint spiral arm structure which has resulted in it receiving a galaxy morphological classification of SAB(s)d.\nLike other galaxies with a similar type, NGC 5585 exhibits a moderate level of star formation that is mostly concentrated in the central region. To date, 47 distinct regions of star formation have been identified. Despite this, the galaxy's visible components appear to form only a tiny fraction of the total mass present as the gravity of the visible portion of the disc does not explain the observed rotation curve even extremely close to the center. This suggests that NGC 5585 has a very large dark matter component that is more reflective of what is normally seen in dwarf galaxies than a galaxy of this size. Even the gravity of the galaxy's H I regions appears to have more impact than the visible components of the galaxy.\nA total of five supernova remnants (SNRs) have been observed in NGC 5585 to date. One of the SNRs is extremely large with dimensions of about 200 x 90 parsecs (650 x 300 ly) and its x-ray emissions are so powerful that it actually distorted the initial x-ray emission contour map for the entire galaxy that was obtained by the Einstein Observatory in the early 1980s. The SNR's large size and the fact that it is still expanding at an abnormally high rate of more than 85 km/s (53 mi/s) suggest that it is probably located in a low-density area of NGC 5585's interstellar medium.\nA 1997 paper estimated that the galaxy probably has about one supernova every 1,000 years."},{"id":4579,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4579"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"42168"},{"object_catalogue":"Messier","object_number":"58"}],"constelation":"vir","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4579?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/M58s_%28visible%29.jpg/425px-M58s_%28visible%29.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/M58s_%28visible%29.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/M58s_%28visible%29.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4e/Ngc4579-hst-R791_658G791B547.jpg/400px-Ngc4579-hst-R791_658G791B547.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Ngc4579-hst-R791_658G791B547.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Ngc4579-hst-R791_658G791B547.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4579","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Seyfert Galaxy","type_shortcut":"Seyfert","classe":"SAB(rs)b","rightAsc":"12:37:43","declination":"11 49 05","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.5,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"B, L, iR, vmbM, r; = M58","id1":"UGC 7796","id2":"MCG 2-32-160","id3":"VCC 1727","notes":"","overview":"Messier 58 (also known as M58 and NGC 4579) is a barred spiral galaxy located within the constellation Virgo, approximately 68 million light-years away from Earth.

Nonetheless, NGC 2419 is a 9th magnitude object and is readily viewed, in good sky conditions, with good quality telescopes as small as 102mm (four inches) in aperture. Intrinsically it is one of the brightest and most massive globular clusters of our galaxy, having an absolute magnitude of -9.42 and being 900,000 times more massive than our Sun.\r\nIt was proposed too NGC 2419 could be, as Omega Centauri, the remmant of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy disrupted and accreted by the Milky Way. However, later research seems to disprove that possibility\r\nAstronomer Leos Ondra has noted that NGC 2419 would be the \"best and brightest\" for any observers in the Andromeda Galaxy, looking for globular clusters in our galaxy since it lies outside the obscuring density of the main disk. This is analogous to the way the cluster G1 can be seen orbiting outside of the Andromeda Galaxy from Earth."},{"id":4030,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4030"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"37845"}],"constelation":"vir","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4030?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/HAWK-I_NGC_4030.jpg/401px-HAWK-I_NGC_4030.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/HAWK-I_NGC_4030.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/HAWK-I_NGC_4030.jpg"},{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ngc4030-hst-R814GB450.jpg/400px-Ngc4030-hst-R814GB450.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Ngc4030-hst-R814GB450.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Ngc4030-hst-R814GB450.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4030","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"SA(s)bc","rightAsc":"12:00:23","declination":"-1 05 59","distance":null,"magnitudo":10.6,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"cB, L, vlE, psmbM, B stnr","id1":"UGC 6993","id2":"MCG 0-31-16","id3":"ZWG 13.33","notes":"IRAS11578-0049","overview":"NGC 4030 is a grand design spiral galaxy located about 64 million light years away in the constellation Virgo.

Messier 98 has a blue shift and is approaching us at about 140 km/s.\nThe morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(s)ab, which indicates it is a spiral galaxy that displays mixed barred and non-barred features with intermediate to tightly-wound arms and no ring. It is highly inclined to the line of sight at an angle of 74Â° and has a maximum rotation velocity of 236 km/s.

It has the morphological classification SA(s)a pec, which indicates this is a pure, unbarred spiral galaxy with tightly-wound arms and peculiar features. There is an asymmetrical spiral arm and an extended halo around the galaxy.\nThis is a LINER 2 galaxy that displays an extended emission of X-rays in the region of the nucleus. A hard X-ray source at the center most likely indicates an active galactic nucleus. The stellar population in the nucleus, and a ring at an angular radius of 6?, shows an age of only one billion years and is generally younger than the surrounding stellar population. This suggests that a burst of star formation took place in the nucleus roughly one billion years ago.\nIn 1984, a Type II-L supernova was discovered in this galaxy. Designated 1984E, the spectrum of this event at maximum light showed prominent balmer lines that indicated the explosion occurred inside a dense shell of hydrogen surrounding the star. This shell was likely created by a strong stellar wind from the progenitor star. A second supernova was discovered in 2003; this time of type 1a.

The nebula has a prominent two-lobed shape, possibly due to a binary companion or magnetic fields and has an âSâ-shaped symmetry of the lobes â the lobes opposite each other appear similar. This is believed to be due to the presence of a companion to the central white dwarf. However, the gas walls of the two lobed structures are not at all smooth, but rather are rippled in a complex way. \nThe central white dwarf, the remaining compact core of the original star, produces a powerful and hot (?10,000 K) wind blowing with a speed of 300 kilometers per second, which has generated waves 100 billion kilometres high. The waves are generated by supersonic shocks formed when the local gas is compressed and heated in front of the rapidly expanding lobes. Atoms caught in the shocks radiate a visible light.  These winds are what give this nebula its unique 'spider' shape and also contribute to the expansion of the nebula.\nThe star at the center of the Red Spider Nebula is surrounded by a dust shell making its exact properties hard to determine. Its surface temperature is probably 150,000-250,000 K although a temperature of 340,000 K or even 500,000 K is not ruled out, making it among the hottest white dwarf stars known.\nThe Red Spider Nebula lies toward the constellation of Sagittarius.

It was discovered in 1785 by the British astronomer Frederick William Herschel I, who catalogued it as a bright, nebulous patch. The brightest galaxy within the northern Coma Cluster, it is located at a distance of 94 million parsecs (308 million light years) from Earth. Unlike a flattened, disc-shaped spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, NGC 4889 has no visible dust lanes or spiral arms and has a smooth, featureless, egg-shaped profile that diminishes in luminosity with distance from the center. At the core of the galaxy is a supermassive black hole that heats up the intracluster medium through the action of friction from infalling gases and dust. The X-ray emission from the galaxy extends out to several million light years of the cluster.\nAs with other similar elliptical galaxies, only a fraction of the mass of NGC 4889 is in the form of stars. They have a flattened, unequal distribution that bulges within its edge. Between the stars is a dense interstellar medium full of heavy elements emitted by evolved stars. In addition it also has a diffuse stellar halo that extends out to one million light years in diameter. Orbiting the galaxy is a very large population of globular clusters. NGC 4889 is also a strong source of soft X-ray, ultraviolet, and radio frequency radiation.\nAs the largest and the most massive galaxy easily visible to Earth, NGC 4889 has played an important role in both amateur and professional astronomy, and has become a prototype in studying the dynamical evolution of other supergiant elliptical galaxies in the more distant universe."},{"id":4634,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"4634"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"42707"}],"constelation":"com","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/4634?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"4634","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinPair","classe":"5","rightAsc":"12:42:40","declination":"14 17 45","distance":null,"magnitudo":11.4,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"vF, L, mE 135deg +/- ,vgbM","id1":"UGC 7875","id2":"MCG 3-32-86","id3":"ZWG 99.112","notes":"KCPG 351B","overview":"NGC 4634 is a spiral galaxy located about 70 million light-years from the Sun in the constellation of Coma Berenices.\n^ a b \"Glowing gas and dark dust in a side-on spiral\".

NGC 7129 is located just half a degree from nearby cluster NGC 7142.\nThe nebula is rosebud-shaped; the young stars have blown a large, oddly shaped bubble in the molecular cloud that once surrounded them at their birth. The rosy pink color comes from glowing dust grains on the surface of the bubble being heated by the intense light from the young stars within. The ultra-violet and visible light produced by the young stars is absorbed by the surrounding dust grains. They are heated by this process and release the energy at longer infrared wavelengths as photographed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The reddish colors in the false-colour infrared image suggest the distribution of hydrocarbon rich molecular material.\nThe much cooler molecular cloud outside the bubble is mostly invisible to Spitzer. However, three very young stars near the center of the nebula are sending jets of supersonic gas into the cloud. The collision of these jets heats carbon monoxide molecules in the nebula.

The galaxy is one of the few elliptical galaxies proven to have significant amounts of dark matter.

The dark matter halo is estimated to have 10 times the mass of the stars in the galaxy.\nNGC 4555 is important because of its isolation. Most elliptical galaxies are found in the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies, and almost all those for which dark matter estimates are available are located in the centres of these larger systems.

The bright rim is the surface of the dense cloud that is being illuminated and ionized by a very bright, massive star (HD 206267) that is just to the west of IC 1396A. (In the Figure above, the massive star is just to the left of the edge of the image.) The entire IC 1396 region is ionized by the massive star, except for dense globules that can protect themselves from the star's harsh ultraviolet rays.\nThe Elephant's Trunk nebula is now thought to be a site of star formation, containing several very young (less than 100,000 yr) stars that were discovered in infrared images in 2003. Two older (but still young, a couple of million years, by the standards of stars, which live for billions of years) stars are present in a small, circular cavity in the head of the globule.

It was discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887. Nicholas Mayall was the first to suggest that the object is extragalactic in 1935. Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but its status remained uncertain for decades. The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962, and it was found to be approaching the Milky Way at approximately 350 km/s, strengthening the evidence for its membership in the Local Group. Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by direct measurements of its distance based on observations of Cepheids. Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the plane of the Milky Way and is therefore heavily obscured by interstellar matter.\nThe apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup.\nIC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies. It has many more Wolf-Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpcÂ˛) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpcÂ˛) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpcÂ˛). Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is considerably smaller. Its higher metallicity compared to the SMC suggests that star formation activity has continued for a longer time period. The evolutionary status of the Wolf-Rayet stars suggests that they all formed in a relatively short timespan. The ratio between the two types of Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars and WN stars) in IC 10 is very different from the ratio in other galaxies in the Local Group, which may be somehow due to the starburst nature of the galaxy. Currently the galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04â0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for only a few billion years longer.\nObservations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. It is hypothesized that any small grains that formerly existed were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars that were formed in the galaxy's recent burst of star formation.\nThe galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68? Ă 80?, which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5? Ă 7.0?). IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope.

This activity is caused by matter flowing onto a 65 million solar mass (M?) supermassive black hole at the core. Morphologically, this is an unbarred lenticular galaxy with tightly-wound spiral arms, while shell and tidal tail features suggest that it has undergone a cosmologically-recent merger or interaction event. NGC 5548 is approximately 245 million light years away and appears in the constellation BoĂśtes. The apparent visual magnitude of NGC 5548 is approximately 13.3 in the V band.\nIn 1943, this galaxy was one of twelve nebulae listed by American astronomer Carl Keenan Seyfert that showed broad emission lines in their nuclei. Members of this class of objects became known as Seyfert galaxies, and they were noted to have a higher than normal surface brightness in their nuclei. Observation of NGC 5548 during the 1960s with radio telescopes showed an enhanced level of radio emission. Spectrograms of the nucleus made in 1966 showed that the energized region was confined to a volume a few parsecs across, where temperature were around 7004140000000000000?14000 K and the plasma had a dispersion velocity of Âą450 km/s.\nAmong astronomers, the accepted explanation for the active nucleus in NGC 5548 is the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the core. This object is surrounded by an orbiting disk of accreted matter drawn in from the surroundings. As material is drawn into the outer parts of this disk, it becomes photoionized, producing broad emission lines in the optical and ultraviolet bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. A wind of ionized matter, organized in filamentary structures at distances of 1â14 light days from the center, is flowing outward in the direction perpendicular to the accretion disk plane.\nThe mass of the central black hole can be estimated based on the properties of the emission lines in the core region. Combined measurements yield an estimated mass of 7007654000000000000?6.54+0.26\n?0.25Ă107 M?. In other words, it is some 65 million times the mass of the Sun. This result is consistent with other methods of estimating the mass of the SMBH in the nucleus of NGC 5548. Matter is falling onto this black hole at the estimated rate of 6998300000000000000?0.03 M? per year, whereas mass is flowing outward from the core at or above the rate of 6999920000000000000?0.92 M? each year. The inner part of the accretion disk surrounding the SMBH forms a thick, hot corona spanning several light hours that is emitting X-rays. When this radiation reaches the optically thick part of the accretion disk at a radius of around 1â2 light days, the X-rays are converted into heat."},{"id":178,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"178"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"2349"}],"constelation":"cet","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/178?format=json","photos":[{"thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/NGC178-hst-R814GB300.jpg/400px-NGC178-hst-R814GB300.jpg","normal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/NGC178-hst-R814GB300.jpg","orginal":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/NGC178-hst-R814GB300.jpg"}],"fov":20,"unique_name":"178","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Group of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinGroup","classe":"SBm","rightAsc":"00:39:08","declination":"-14 10 22","distance":null,"magnitudo":12.3,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"F, S, mE 0deg , bM; = IC 39","id1":"IC 39","id2":"MCG -82","id3":"8ZW 34","notes":"IRAS00366-1426","overview":"NGC 178 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Cetus.

This spectacular nebula consists largely of glowing gases from the star's outer layers ejected during the final stages of its life when it had run out of the fuel necessary to sustain its core fusion processes. The remnants of its core will remain as a white dwarf. \nIt is often cited as a member of the open cluster NGC 2818A framing it, however, radial velocity differences between the planetary nebula and open cluster suggest a chance alignment. The case is an example of a superimposed pair, similar to NGC 2438 and M46.\nPartly because of their small total mass, open clusters have relatively poor gravitational cohesion. Consequently, open clusters tend to disperse after a relatively short time, typically some 10 million years, because of external gravitational influences amid other factors. Under exceptional conditions, open clusters can remain intact for up to 100 million years.\nTheoretical models predict that planetary nebulae can form from main-sequence stars of between 8 and 1 solar masses, which puts their age at 40 million years and older. Although there are a few hundred known open clusters within that age range, a variety of reasons limit the chances of finding a member of an open cluster in a planetary nebula phase. One such reason is that the planetary nebula phase for more massive stars belonging to younger clusters is on the order of thousands of years - a blink of the eye in cosmic terms.

The supernova occurred approximately 5000 years ago from our point of view. In 1998 a pulsar (named PSR J0537-6910) was discovered with the very fast rotation period of 16 milliseconds and the same approximate age as the supernova remnant.

The brightest galaxy within the northern Coma Cluster, it is located at a distance of 94 million parsecs (308 million light years) from Earth. Unlike a flattened, disc-shaped spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, NGC 4889 has no visible dust lanes or spiral arms and has a smooth, featureless, egg-shaped profile that diminishes in luminosity with distance from the center. At the core of the galaxy is a supermassive black hole that heats up the intracluster medium through the action of friction from infalling gases and dust. The X-ray emission from the galaxy extends out to several million light years of the cluster.\nAs with other similar elliptical galaxies, only a fraction of the mass of NGC 4889 is in the form of stars. They have a flattened, unequal distribution that bulges within its edge. Between the stars is a dense interstellar medium full of heavy elements emitted by evolved stars. In addition it also has a diffuse stellar halo that extends out to one million light years in diameter. Orbiting the galaxy is a very large population of globular clusters. NGC 4889 is also a strong source of soft X-ray, ultraviolet, and radio frequency radiation.\nAs the largest and the most massive galaxy easily visible to Earth, NGC 4889 has played an important role in both amateur and professional astronomy, and has become a prototype in studying the dynamical evolution of other supergiant elliptical galaxies in the more distant universe."},{"id":5164,"catalogues":[{"object_catalogue":"NGC","object_number":"5164"},{"object_catalogue":"PGC","object_number":"47124"}],"constelation":"uma","url":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint/singleAPI/5164?format=json","photos":[],"fov":20,"unique_name":"5164","otype":"Galaxy","type":"Galaxy in Pair of Galaxies","type_shortcut":"GinPair","classe":"SBcr","rightAsc":"13:27:11","declination":"55 29 13","distance":null,"magnitudo":13.0,"dimAxb":null,"pa":null,"description":"cF, S, iR","id1":"UGC 8458","id2":"MCG 23276","id3":"MK 257","notes":"ZWG 271.41, KCPG 376","overview":"NGC 5164 is a galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major.

This galaxy was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier on February 19, 1771. Messier 49 is positioned 4.1Â° west-southwest of the star Epsilon Virginis.\r\nAs an elliptical galaxy, Messier 49 has the physical form of a radio galaxy, but it only has the radio emission of a normal galaxy. From the detected radio emission, the core region is emitting roughly 1053 erg (1046 J or 1022 YJ) of energy. The nucleus of this galaxy is emitting X-rays, suggests the likely presence of a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 5.65 Ă 108 solar masses, or 565 million times the mass of the Sun. X-ray emissions shows a structure to the north of Messier 49 that resembles a bow shock. To the southwest of the core, the luminous outline of the galaxy can be traced out to a distance of 260 kpc. The only supernova event observed within this galaxy is SN 1969Q, discovered in June 1969.\r\nThis galaxy has a large collection of globular clusters, estimated at about 5,900. However, this count is far exceeded by the 13,450 globular clusters orbiting the supergiant elliptical galaxy Messier 87. On average, the globular clusters of M 49 are about 10 billion years old. Between 2000â2009, strong evidence for stellar mass black hole was discovered in an M 49 cluster. A second candidate was announced in 2011.\r\nMessier 49 was the first member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies to be discovered. It is the most luminous member of that cluster and more luminous than any galaxy closer to the Earth. This galaxy forms part of the smaller Virgo B subcluster located 4.5Â° away from the dynamic center of the Virgo Cluster, centered on Messier 87.

About 290 million light-years away, they began the process of colliding and merging about 290 million years ago. Their name refers to the long tails produced by tidal actionâthe relative difference between gravitational pulls on the near and far parts of each galaxyâknown here as a galactic tide. Members of the Coma cluster, it is a possibility that both galaxies have experienced collision, and will continue colliding until they coalesce.\r\nThe colors of the galaxy are peculiar.

It was Karl Gordon Henize in 1967 who first described NGC 5189 as quasi-planetary based on its spectral emissions.\nSeen through the telescope it seems to have an S shape, reminiscent of a barred spiral galaxy. The S shape, together with point-symmetric knots in the nebula, have for a long time hinted to astronomers that a binary central star is present. Observations with the Southern African Large Telescope have finally found a white dwarf companion in a 4.04 day orbit around the rare low-mass Wolf-Rayet type central star of NGC 5189.

It has been known as the Owl Nebula ever since.\r\nThe nebula is approximately 8,000 years old. It is approximately circular in cross-section with a little visible internal structure. It was formed from the outflow of material from the stellar wind of the central star as it evolved along the asymptotic giant branch. The nebula is arranged in three concentric shells, with the outermost shell being about 20â30% larger than the inner shell. The owl-like appearance of the nebula is the result of an inner shell that is not circularly symmetric, but instead forms a barrel-like structure aligned at an angle of 45Â° to the line of sight.\r\nThe nebula holds about 0.13 solar masses of matter, including hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur; all with a density of less than 100 particles per cubic centimeter. Its outer radius is around 0.91 ly (0.28 pc) and it is expanding with velocities in the range of 27â39 km/s into the surrounding interstellar medium.\r\nThe 14th magnitude central star has since reached the turning point of its evolution where it condenses to form a white dwarf. It has 55â60% of the Sun's mass, 41â148 times the brightness of the Sun, and an effective temperature of 123,000 K.
