    Hi, welcome to Zorya.co, first astronomical charts finder on the internet.
    DateBase includes several catalogues, and for specific object finds matching maps.
    For now it contains 3 sets of maps up to maximum magnitude of 12.6 so for
    darker objects don't generates charts.
    Application allows you to filter results by catalogues within they are,
    by maximum and minimum brightness of object, by type and by position you are right now.
    You can also just search by popular name of object.
    If you have any suggestions feel free to leave me message.
    To do that use Leave message button in footer of page.
